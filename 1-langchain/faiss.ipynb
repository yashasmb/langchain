The villagers often warned him not to go too deep, for the forest was vast and mysterious. But Arjunâ€™s curiosity was stronger than his fear. He admired the towering trees, the chirping of colorful birds, and the gentle murmur of the flowing river.'),\n",

His footsteps crunched on dry leaves, and he noticed the air becoming cooler and quieter. Soon, he stumbled upon something unusualâ€”an old stone bridge, half-hidden beneath moss and vines. The bridge looked ancient, as though it had been forgotten by time itself.'),\n",
