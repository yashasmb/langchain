I arrived\\r\\nhere yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and\\r\\nincreasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh,\\r\\nI feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and\\r\\nfills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has\\r\\ntravelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste\\r\\nof those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become\\r\\nmore fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat\\r\\nof frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\r\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its\\r\\nbroad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.\\r\\nThere—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding\\r\\nnavigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we\\r\\nmay be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region\\r\\nhitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be\\r\\nwithout example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in\\r\\nthose undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal\\r\\nlight? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and\\r\\nmay regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to\\r\\nrender their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my\\r\\nardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited,\\r\\nand may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my\\r\\nenticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and\\r\\nto induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when\\r\\nhe embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of\\r\\ndiscovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false,\\r\\nyou cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind,\\r\\nto the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those\\r\\ncountries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by\\r\\nascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be\\r\\neffected by an undertaking such as mine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter,\\r\\nand I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for\\r\\nnothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a\\r\\npoint on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been\\r\\nthe favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of\\r\\nthe various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the\\r\\nNorth Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember\\r\\nthat a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\r\\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was\\r\\npassionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my\\r\\nfamiliarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on\\r\\nlearning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me\\r\\nto embark in a seafaring life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose\\r\\neffusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and\\r\\nfor one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also\\r\\nmight obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are\\r\\nconsecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the\\r\\ndisappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and\\r\\nmy thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even\\r\\nnow, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.\\r\\nI commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on\\r\\nseveral expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,\\r\\nthirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during\\r\\nthe day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of\\r\\nmedicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer\\r\\nmight derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as\\r\\nan under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must\\r\\nown I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the\\r\\nvessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable\\r\\ndid he consider my services.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My\\r\\nlife might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every\\r\\nenticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would\\r\\nanswer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes\\r\\nfluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long\\r\\nand difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I\\r\\nam required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain\\r\\nmy own, when theirs are failing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly\\r\\nover the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far\\r\\nmore agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive,\\r\\nif you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a\\r\\ngreat difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for\\r\\nhours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your\\r\\nveins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St.\\r\\nPetersburgh and Archangel.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\r\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\r\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\\r\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail\\r\\nuntil the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I\\r\\nanswer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass\\r\\nbefore you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and\\r\\nsave me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and\\r\\nkindness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYour affectionate brother,\\r\\nR. Walton\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 2\\n\\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\\n\\n\\r\\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a\\r\\nsecond step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am\\r\\noccupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to\\r\\nbe men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\\r\\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\\r\\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will\\r\\nbe none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will\\r\\nendeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it\\r\\nis true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire\\r\\nthe company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to\\r\\nmine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of\\r\\na friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a\\r\\ncultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to\\r\\napprove or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your\\r\\npoor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.\\r\\nBut it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first\\r\\nfourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle\\r\\nThomas’ books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated\\r\\npoets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power\\r\\nto derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived\\r\\nthe necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\r\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\r\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\r\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\r\\ncall it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\r\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour\\r\\nto regulate my mind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\r\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some\\r\\nfeelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged\\r\\nbosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and\\r\\nenterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more\\r\\ncharacteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and\\r\\nin the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by\\r\\ncultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became\\r\\nacquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in\\r\\nthis city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\r\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance,\\r\\nadded to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous\\r\\nto engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your\\r\\ngentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character\\r\\nthat I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on\\r\\nboard ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a\\r\\nmariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience\\r\\npaid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to\\r\\nsecure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a\\r\\nlady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.\\r\\nSome years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having\\r\\namassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to\\r\\nthe match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was\\r\\nbathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\\r\\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and\\r\\nthat her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured\\r\\nthe suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly\\r\\nabandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he\\r\\nhad designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on\\r\\nhis rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and\\r\\nthen himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with\\r\\nher lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour\\r\\nto my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country,\\r\\nnor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to\\r\\nher inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then\\r\\nhe is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant\\r\\ncarelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more\\r\\nastonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would\\r\\ncommand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a\\r\\nconsolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my\\r\\nresolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed\\r\\nuntil the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully\\r\\nsevere, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably\\r\\nearly season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do\\r\\nnothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and\\r\\nconsiderateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.\\r\\nIt is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation,\\r\\nhalf pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am\\r\\ngoing to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill\\r\\nno albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come\\r\\nback to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my\\r\\nallusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment\\r\\nto, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\\r\\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work\\r\\nin my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—painstaking,\\r\\na workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a\\r\\nlove for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my\\r\\nprojects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild\\r\\nsea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having\\r\\ntraversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or\\r\\nAmerica? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the\\r\\nreverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every\\r\\nopportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most\\r\\nto support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection,\\r\\nshould you never hear from me again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYour affectionate brother,\\r\\nRobert Walton\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 3\\n\\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\\n\\n\\r\\nJuly 7th, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy dear Sister,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced on my\\r\\nvoyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward\\r\\nvoyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,\\r\\nperhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and\\r\\napparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually\\r\\npass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing,\\r\\nappear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is\\r\\nthe height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern\\r\\ngales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\\r\\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.\\r\\nOne or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which\\r\\nexperienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content\\r\\nif nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I\\r\\nwill not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut success shall crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have\\r\\ngone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves\\r\\nbeing witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the\\r\\nuntamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved\\r\\nwill of man?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish.\\r\\nHeaven bless my beloved sister!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nR.W.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 4\\n\\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\\n\\n\\r\\nAugust 5th, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it,\\r\\nalthough it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come\\r\\ninto your possession.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the\\r\\nship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our\\r\\nsituation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a\\r\\nvery thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place\\r\\nin the atmosphere and weather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every\\r\\ndirection, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some\\r\\nof my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious\\r\\nthoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted\\r\\nour solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a\\r\\nsledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a\\r\\nmile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\\r\\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the\\r\\ntraveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities\\r\\nof the ice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many\\r\\nhundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was\\r\\nnot, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it\\r\\nwas impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night\\r\\nthe ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning,\\r\\nfearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about\\r\\nafter the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found\\r\\nall the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone\\r\\nin the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had\\r\\ndrifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog\\r\\nremained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were\\r\\npersuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to\\r\\nbe, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I\\r\\nappeared on deck the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow\\r\\nyou to perish on the open sea.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign\\r\\naccent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the\\r\\nkindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me\\r\\nfrom a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that\\r\\nmy vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the\\r\\nmost precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on\\r\\na voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. Good\\r\\nGod! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety,\\r\\nyour surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his\\r\\nbody dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so\\r\\nwretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as\\r\\nhe had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the\\r\\ndeck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him\\r\\nto swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him\\r\\nup in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow\\r\\ndegrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared\\r\\nthat his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some\\r\\nmeasure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as\\r\\nmy duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have\\r\\ngenerally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments\\r\\nwhen, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the\\r\\nmost trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a\\r\\nbeam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is\\r\\ngenerally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if\\r\\nimpatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men,\\r\\nwho wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be\\r\\ntormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose\\r\\nrestoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the\\r\\nlieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he\\r\\nreplied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some\\r\\ndogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions\\r\\nconcerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon\\r\\nafter, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your\\r\\ncuriosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to\\r\\nmake inquiries.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble\\r\\nyou with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\\r\\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had\\r\\ndestroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree\\r\\nof certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller\\r\\nmight have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could\\r\\nnot judge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\\r\\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the\\r\\nsledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the\\r\\ncabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have\\r\\npromised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any\\r\\nnew object should appear in sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present\\r\\nday. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and\\r\\nappears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are\\r\\nso conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although\\r\\nthey have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to\\r\\nlove him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy\\r\\nand compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being\\r\\neven now in wreck so attractive and amiable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on\\r\\nthe wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken\\r\\nby misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have\\r\\nany fresh incidents to record.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAugust 13th, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration\\r\\nand my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature\\r\\ndestroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle,\\r\\nyet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words\\r\\nare culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled\\r\\neloquence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\\r\\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\\r\\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests\\r\\nhimself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me\\r\\non mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered\\r\\nattentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into\\r\\nevery minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led\\r\\nby the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give\\r\\nutterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour\\r\\nthat warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every\\r\\nhope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a\\r\\nsmall price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the\\r\\ndominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As\\r\\nI spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\\r\\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his\\r\\neyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from\\r\\nbetween his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length\\r\\nhe spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you\\r\\ndrunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you\\r\\nwill dash the cup from your lips!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of\\r\\ngrief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours\\r\\nof repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself\\r\\nfor being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he\\r\\nled me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history\\r\\nof my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains\\r\\nof reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a\\r\\nmore intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and\\r\\nexpressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not\\r\\nenjoy this blessing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but\\r\\nhalf made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought\\r\\nto be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once\\r\\nhad a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to\\r\\njudge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have\\r\\nno cause for despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that\\r\\ntouched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the\\r\\nbeauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these\\r\\nwonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from\\r\\nearth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be\\r\\noverwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will\\r\\nbe like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no\\r\\ngrief or folly ventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You\\r\\nwould not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and\\r\\nretirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this\\r\\nonly renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this\\r\\nwonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is\\r\\nwhich he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I\\r\\never knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but\\r\\nnever-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things,\\r\\nunequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression\\r\\nand a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAugust 19th, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton,\\r\\nthat I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at\\r\\none time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me\\r\\nto alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did;\\r\\nand I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent\\r\\nto sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters\\r\\nwill be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\\r\\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am,\\r\\nI imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct\\r\\nyou if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.\\r\\nPrepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we\\r\\namong the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief,\\r\\nperhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and\\r\\nmysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with\\r\\nthe ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in\\r\\nits series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is\\r\\ncomposed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication,\\r\\nyet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his\\r\\nmisfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative,\\r\\npartly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if\\r\\nit were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is\\r\\nnearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I\\r\\nunderstand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt\\r\\nhim; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you;\\r\\nnothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how\\r\\nirrevocably it is determined.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should\\r\\nbe at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved\\r\\nevery night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as\\r\\nnearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I\\r\\nshould be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless\\r\\nafford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from\\r\\nhis own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future\\r\\nday! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears;\\r\\nhis lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his\\r\\nthin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated\\r\\nby the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the\\r\\nstorm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\r\\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of\\r\\nthat republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics,\\r\\nand my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.\\r\\nHe was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable\\r\\nattention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied\\r\\nby the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\\r\\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband\\r\\nand the father of a family.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain\\r\\nfrom relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a\\r\\nflourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man,\\r\\nwhose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not\\r\\nbear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly\\r\\nbeen distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\\r\\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the\\r\\ntown of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved\\r\\nBeaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in\\r\\nthese unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led\\r\\nhis friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He\\r\\nlost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him\\r\\nto begin the world again through his credit and assistance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months\\r\\nbefore my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened\\r\\nto the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he\\r\\nentered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very\\r\\nsmall sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to\\r\\nprovide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to\\r\\nprocure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval was,\\r\\nconsequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling\\r\\nwhen he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his\\r\\nmind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of\\r\\nany exertion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with\\r\\ndespair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no\\r\\nother prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an\\r\\nuncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She\\r\\nprocured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a\\r\\npittance scarcely sufficient to support life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more\\r\\nentirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in\\r\\nthe tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a\\r\\nbeggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin weeping\\r\\nbitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit\\r\\nto the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of\\r\\nhis friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\\r\\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this\\r\\ncircumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.\\r\\nThere was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it\\r\\nnecessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former\\r\\nyears he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and\\r\\nso was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of\\r\\ngratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\\r\\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a\\r\\ndesire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she\\r\\nhad endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.\\r\\nEverything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to\\r\\nshelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher\\r\\nwind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion\\r\\nin her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her\\r\\nhitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\\r\\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\\r\\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their\\r\\nunion they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and\\r\\ninterest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for\\r\\nher weakened frame.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at\\r\\nNaples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for\\r\\nseveral years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they\\r\\nseemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to\\r\\nbestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of\\r\\nbenevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their\\r\\nplaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and\\r\\nhelpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and\\r\\nwhose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery,\\r\\naccording as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep\\r\\nconsciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life,\\r\\nadded to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\\r\\nthat while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience,\\r\\nof charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all\\r\\nseemed but one train of enjoyment to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\\r\\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years\\r\\nold, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a\\r\\nweek on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made\\r\\nthem enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty;\\r\\nit was a necessity, a passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she\\r\\nhad been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\\r\\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\\r\\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of\\r\\nhalf-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One\\r\\nday, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me,\\r\\nvisited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down\\r\\nby care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among\\r\\nthese there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She\\r\\nappeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little\\r\\nvagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living\\r\\ngold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of\\r\\ndistinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless,\\r\\nand her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and\\r\\nsweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct\\r\\nspecies, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\\r\\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not\\r\\nher child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and\\r\\nhad died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people\\r\\nto nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their\\r\\neldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those\\r\\nItalians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the\\r\\nschiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his\\r\\ncountry. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still\\r\\nlingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was\\r\\nconfiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her\\r\\nfoster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among\\r\\ndark-leaved brambles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our\\r\\nvilla a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed\\r\\nradiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the\\r\\nchamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my\\r\\nmother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They\\r\\nwere fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but\\r\\nit would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence\\r\\nafforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and\\r\\nthe result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my\\r\\nmore than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\\r\\nmy pleasures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with\\r\\nwhich all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On\\r\\nthe evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said\\r\\nplayfully, “I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.”\\r\\nAnd when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I,\\r\\nwith childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon\\r\\nElizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\\r\\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\\r\\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the\\r\\nkind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death\\r\\nshe was to be mine only.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\r\\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.\\r\\nI need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.\\r\\nHarmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that\\r\\nsubsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\\r\\nand more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a\\r\\nmore intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for\\r\\nknowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\\r\\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the\\r\\nsublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm,\\r\\nthe silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she\\r\\nfound ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated\\r\\nwith a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I\\r\\ndelighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I\\r\\ndesired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of\\r\\nnature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\\r\\nearliest sensations I can remember.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up\\r\\nentirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We\\r\\npossessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern\\r\\nshore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.\\r\\nWe resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed\\r\\nin considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach\\r\\nmyself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows\\r\\nin general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one\\r\\namong them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of\\r\\nsingular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\\r\\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed\\r\\nheroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly\\r\\nadventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in\\r\\nwhich the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round\\r\\nTable of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\\r\\nthe holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents\\r\\nwere possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they\\r\\nwere not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents\\r\\nand creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with\\r\\nother families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and\\r\\ngratitude assisted the development of filial love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in\\r\\nmy temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager\\r\\ndesire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that\\r\\nneither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the\\r\\npolitics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of\\r\\nheaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward\\r\\nsubstance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of\\r\\nman that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or\\r\\nin its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of\\r\\nthings. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men\\r\\nwere his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose\\r\\nnames are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our\\r\\nspecies. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in\\r\\nour peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet\\r\\nglance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\\r\\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in\\r\\nmy study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to\\r\\nsubdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill\\r\\nentrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so\\r\\nperfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and\\r\\ntenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to\\r\\nhim the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim\\r\\nof his soaring ambition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before\\r\\nmisfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive\\r\\nusefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing\\r\\nthe picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by\\r\\ninsensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to\\r\\nmyself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find\\r\\nit arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources;\\r\\nbut, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has\\r\\nswept away all my hopes and joys.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\\r\\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection\\r\\nfor that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of\\r\\npleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to\\r\\nremain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of\\r\\nthe works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he\\r\\nattempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed\\r\\nthis feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and\\r\\nbounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked\\r\\ncarelessly at the title page of my book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My\\r\\ndear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that\\r\\nthe principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system\\r\\nof science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the\\r\\nancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the\\r\\nformer were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly\\r\\nhave thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was,\\r\\nby returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that\\r\\nthe train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to\\r\\nmy ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means\\r\\nassured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read\\r\\nwith the greatest avidity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\\r\\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied\\r\\nthe wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures\\r\\nknown to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been\\r\\nimbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of\\r\\nthe intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always\\r\\ncame from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to\\r\\nhave avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and\\r\\nunexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural\\r\\nphilosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions\\r\\nas tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with\\r\\ntheir practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had\\r\\npartially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a\\r\\nwonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to\\r\\nspeak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were\\r\\nutterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments\\r\\nthat seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and\\r\\nrashly and ignorantly I had repined.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.\\r\\nI took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It\\r\\nmay appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while\\r\\nI followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great\\r\\ndegree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not\\r\\nscientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a\\r\\nstudent’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I\\r\\nentered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone\\r\\nand the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.\\r\\nWealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I\\r\\ncould banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any\\r\\nbut a violent death!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise\\r\\nliberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most\\r\\neagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed\\r\\nthe failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill\\r\\nor fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded\\r\\nsystems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and\\r\\nfloundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by\\r\\nan ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed\\r\\nthe current of my ideas.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive,\\r\\nwhen we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from\\r\\nbehind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful\\r\\nloudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm\\r\\nlasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the\\r\\ndoor, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak\\r\\nwhich stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling\\r\\nlight vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted\\r\\nstump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a\\r\\nsingular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to\\r\\nthin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.\\r\\nOn this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and\\r\\nexcited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he\\r\\nhad formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new\\r\\nand astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius\\r\\nAgrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\\r\\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed\\r\\nstudies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that\\r\\nhad so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those\\r\\ncaprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at\\r\\nonce gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its\\r\\nprogeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest\\r\\ndisdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold\\r\\nof real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and\\r\\nthe branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure\\r\\nfoundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we\\r\\nbound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost\\r\\nmiraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the\\r\\nguardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to\\r\\navert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop\\r\\nme. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul\\r\\nwhich followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.\\r\\nIt was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution,\\r\\nhappiness with their disregard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny\\r\\nwas too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible\\r\\ndestruction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\r\\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should\\r\\nbecome a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the\\r\\nschools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my\\r\\neducation that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my\\r\\nnative country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before\\r\\nthe day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an\\r\\nomen, as it were, of my future misery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in\\r\\nthe greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\\r\\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded\\r\\nto our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was\\r\\nmenaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her\\r\\nwatchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was\\r\\nsaved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On\\r\\nthe third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most\\r\\nalarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the\\r\\nworst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women\\r\\ndid not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\\r\\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the\\r\\nprospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your\\r\\nfather. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.\\r\\nAlas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been,\\r\\nis it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will\\r\\nendeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of\\r\\nmeeting you in another world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need\\r\\nnot describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most\\r\\nirreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair\\r\\nthat is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can\\r\\npersuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence\\r\\nappeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a\\r\\nbeloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and\\r\\ndear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the\\r\\nreflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of\\r\\nthe evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not\\r\\nthat rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a\\r\\nsorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when\\r\\ngrief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon\\r\\nthe lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was\\r\\ndead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our\\r\\ncourse with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains\\r\\nwhom the spoiler has not seized.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now\\r\\nagain determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It\\r\\nappeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the\\r\\nhouse of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but\\r\\nit did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that\\r\\nremained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some\\r\\ndegree consoled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She\\r\\nlooked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She\\r\\ndevoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and\\r\\ncousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the\\r\\nsunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret\\r\\nin her endeavours to make us forget.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with\\r\\nus. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and\\r\\nto become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader\\r\\nand saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry\\r\\ndeeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said\\r\\nlittle, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance\\r\\na restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of\\r\\ncommerce.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade\\r\\nourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we retired under the\\r\\npretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when\\r\\nat morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they\\r\\nwere all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more,\\r\\nmy Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the\\r\\nlast feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the\\r\\nmost melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable\\r\\ncompanions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was\\r\\nnow alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and\\r\\nbe my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and\\r\\ndomestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I\\r\\nloved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but\\r\\nI believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my\\r\\nreflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes\\r\\nrose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at\\r\\nhome, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\\r\\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my\\r\\ndesires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey\\r\\nto Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple\\r\\nof the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment\\r\\nto spend the evening as I pleased.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\\r\\nsome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, the\\r\\nAngel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I\\r\\nturned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe,\\r\\nprofessor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in\\r\\nthe secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my\\r\\nprogress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural\\r\\nphilosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names\\r\\nof my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared.\\r\\n“Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth,\\r\\n“every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely\\r\\nlost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.\\r\\nGood God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to\\r\\ninform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand\\r\\nyears old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this\\r\\nenlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and\\r\\nParacelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of\\r\\nnatural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after\\r\\nmentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence\\r\\na course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that\\r\\nM. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days\\r\\nthat he omitted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered\\r\\nthose authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all\\r\\nthe more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a\\r\\nlittle squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher,\\r\\ntherefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too\\r\\nphilosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the\\r\\nconclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had\\r\\nnot been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\\r\\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth\\r\\nand my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge\\r\\nalong the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for\\r\\nthe dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of\\r\\nmodern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the\\r\\nscience sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand;\\r\\nbut now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\\r\\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was\\r\\nchiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for\\r\\nrealities of little worth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at\\r\\nIngolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities\\r\\nand the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced,\\r\\nI thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the\\r\\nlectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited\\r\\nfellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\\r\\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room,\\r\\nwhich M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his\\r\\ncolleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive\\r\\nof the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at\\r\\nthe back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably\\r\\nerect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a\\r\\nrecapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by\\r\\ndifferent men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most\\r\\ndistinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of\\r\\nthe science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few\\r\\npreparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry,\\r\\nthe terms of which I shall never forget:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and\\r\\nperformed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that\\r\\nmetals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these\\r\\nphilosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to\\r\\npore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They\\r\\npenetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her\\r\\nhiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood\\r\\ncirculates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and\\r\\nalmost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the\\r\\nearthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the\\r\\nfate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling\\r\\nwith a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed\\r\\nthe mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was\\r\\nfilled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done,\\r\\nexclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in\\r\\nthe steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\\r\\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\\r\\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no\\r\\npower to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke,\\r\\nand my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution\\r\\nto return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I\\r\\nbelieved myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman\\r\\na visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in\\r\\npublic, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\\r\\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him\\r\\npretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his\\r\\nfellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my\\r\\nstudies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but\\r\\nwithout the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that “These were men\\r\\nto whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the\\r\\nfoundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give\\r\\nnew names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\\r\\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men\\r\\nof genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately\\r\\nturning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which\\r\\nwas delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his\\r\\nlecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself\\r\\nin measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\\r\\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me\\r\\nashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I\\r\\nrequested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your\\r\\napplication equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is\\r\\nthat branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been\\r\\nand may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study;\\r\\nbut at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man\\r\\nwould make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human\\r\\nknowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not\\r\\nmerely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of\\r\\nnatural philosophy, including mathematics.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various\\r\\nmachines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use\\r\\nof his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange\\r\\ntheir mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I\\r\\ntook my leave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\r\\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most\\r\\ncomprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with\\r\\nardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern\\r\\ninquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and\\r\\ncultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I\\r\\nfound even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information,\\r\\ncombined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that\\r\\naccount the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness\\r\\nwas never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of\\r\\nfrankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand\\r\\nways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\\r\\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first\\r\\nfluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so\\r\\nardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning\\r\\nwhilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.\\r\\nMy ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that\\r\\nof the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how\\r\\nCornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt\\r\\nexultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid\\r\\nno visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some\\r\\ndiscoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can\\r\\nconceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\\r\\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a\\r\\nscientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of\\r\\nmoderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at\\r\\ngreat proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment\\r\\nof one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly\\r\\nthat at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some\\r\\nchemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\\r\\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted\\r\\nwith the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons\\r\\nof any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer\\r\\nconducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my\\r\\nnative town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the\\r\\nstructure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence,\\r\\nI often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold\\r\\nquestion, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how\\r\\nmany things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or\\r\\ncarelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in\\r\\nmy mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those\\r\\nbranches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\\r\\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study\\r\\nwould have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life,\\r\\nwe must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of\\r\\nanatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and\\r\\ncorruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest\\r\\nprecautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do\\r\\nnot ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\\r\\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a\\r\\nchurchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which,\\r\\nfrom being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I\\r\\nwas led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend\\r\\ndays and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every\\r\\nobject the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how\\r\\nthe fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death\\r\\nsucceed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders\\r\\nof the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of\\r\\ncausation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life,\\r\\nuntil from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light\\r\\nso brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\\r\\nimmensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\\r\\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science,\\r\\nthat I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more\\r\\ncertainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some\\r\\nmiracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct\\r\\nand probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I\\r\\nsucceeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became\\r\\nmyself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave\\r\\nplace to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to\\r\\narrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation\\r\\nof my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the\\r\\nsteps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I\\r\\nbeheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men\\r\\nsince the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic\\r\\nscene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\\r\\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards\\r\\nthe object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was\\r\\nlike the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life,\\r\\naided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my\\r\\nfriend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am\\r\\nacquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you\\r\\nwill easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you\\r\\non, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible\\r\\nmisery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how\\r\\ndangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who\\r\\nbelieves his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater\\r\\nthan his nature will allow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long\\r\\ntime concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed\\r\\nthe capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception\\r\\nof it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a\\r\\nwork of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I\\r\\nshould attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler\\r\\norganization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to\\r\\npermit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and\\r\\nwonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\\r\\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\\r\\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\\r\\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet\\r\\nwhen I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and\\r\\nmechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the\\r\\nfoundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and\\r\\ncomplexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with\\r\\nthese feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of\\r\\nthe parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my\\r\\nfirst intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about\\r\\neight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this\\r\\ndetermination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and\\r\\narranging my materials, I began.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a\\r\\nhurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me\\r\\nideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light\\r\\ninto our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source;\\r\\nmany happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could\\r\\nclaim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.\\r\\nPursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon\\r\\nlifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it\\r\\nimpossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to\\r\\ncorruption.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with\\r\\nunremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had\\r\\nbecome emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I\\r\\nfailed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might\\r\\nrealise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had\\r\\ndedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with\\r\\nunrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who\\r\\nshall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed\\r\\ndamps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?\\r\\nMy limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a\\r\\nresistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost\\r\\nall soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing\\r\\ntrance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural\\r\\nstimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones\\r\\nfrom charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets\\r\\nof the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the\\r\\nhouse, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\\r\\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their\\r\\nsockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and\\r\\nthe slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human\\r\\nnature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an\\r\\neagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one\\r\\npursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more\\r\\nplentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were\\r\\ninsensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect\\r\\nthe scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many\\r\\nmiles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence\\r\\ndisquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that\\r\\nwhile you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we\\r\\nshall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption\\r\\nin your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally\\r\\nneglected.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear\\r\\nmy thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an\\r\\nirresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all\\r\\nthat related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which\\r\\nswallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice\\r\\nor faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in\\r\\nconceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in\\r\\nperfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow\\r\\npassion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that\\r\\nthe pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which\\r\\nyou apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your\\r\\ntaste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\\r\\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If\\r\\nthis rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to\\r\\ninterfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been\\r\\nenslaved, Cæsar would have spared his country, America would have been\\r\\ndiscovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been\\r\\ndestroyed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and\\r\\nyour looks remind me to proceed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by\\r\\ninquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring,\\r\\nand summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or\\r\\nthe expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so\\r\\ndeeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered\\r\\nbefore my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly\\r\\nhow well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I\\r\\nappeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\\r\\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every\\r\\nnight I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful\\r\\ndegree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if\\r\\nI had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived\\r\\nthat I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours\\r\\nwould soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive\\r\\naway incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation\\r\\nshould be complete.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\r\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my\\r\\ntoils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the\\r\\ninstruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the\\r\\nlifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain\\r\\npattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when,\\r\\nby the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the\\r\\ncreature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch\\r\\nwhom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs\\r\\nwere in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!\\r\\nGreat God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries\\r\\nbeneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly\\r\\nwhiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his\\r\\nwatery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in\\r\\nwhich they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human\\r\\nnature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of\\r\\ninfusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest\\r\\nand health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but\\r\\nnow that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless\\r\\nhorror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I\\r\\nhad created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\\r\\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded\\r\\nto the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my\\r\\nclothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in\\r\\nvain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I\\r\\nsaw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.\\r\\nDelighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on\\r\\nher lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to\\r\\nchange, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a\\r\\nshroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of\\r\\nthe flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my\\r\\nforehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim\\r\\nand yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters,\\r\\nI beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the\\r\\ncurtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.\\r\\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin\\r\\nwrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was\\r\\nstretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I\\r\\ntook refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I\\r\\nremained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\\r\\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were\\r\\nto announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably\\r\\ngiven life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again\\r\\nendued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on\\r\\nhim while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were\\r\\nrendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have\\r\\nconceived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly\\r\\nthat I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the\\r\\nground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt\\r\\nthe bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant\\r\\nrest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so\\r\\nrapid, the overthrow so complete!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and\\r\\naching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which\\r\\nindicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had\\r\\nthat night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with\\r\\nquick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of\\r\\nthe street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment\\r\\nwhich I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain\\r\\nwhich poured from a black and comfortless sky.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily\\r\\nexercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets\\r\\nwithout any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart\\r\\npalpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not\\r\\ndaring to look about me:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLike one who, on a lonely road,\\r\\nDoth walk in fear and dread,\\r\\nAnd, having once turned round, walks on,\\r\\nAnd turns no more his head;\\r\\nBecause he knows a frightful fiend\\r\\nDoth close behind him tread.\\n\\r\\n[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\\r\\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I\\r\\nremained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me\\r\\nfrom the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the\\r\\nSwiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being\\r\\nopened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My\\r\\ndear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that\\r\\nyou should be here at the very moment of my alighting!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to\\r\\nmy thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my\\r\\nrecollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and\\r\\nmisfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm\\r\\nand serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner,\\r\\nand we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about\\r\\nour mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to\\r\\nIngolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to\\r\\npersuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble\\r\\nart of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last,\\r\\nfor his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the\\r\\nDutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a\\r\\nyear without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at\\r\\nlength overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a\\r\\nvoyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my\\r\\nfather, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so\\r\\nseldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.\\r\\nBut, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my\\r\\nface, “I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you\\r\\nlook as if you had been watching for several nights.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation\\r\\nthat I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I\\r\\nsincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at\\r\\nlength free.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude\\r\\nto, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we\\r\\nsoon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver,\\r\\nthat the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive\\r\\nand walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more\\r\\nthat Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes\\r\\nat the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was\\r\\nalready on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and\\r\\na cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are\\r\\naccustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the\\r\\nother side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was\\r\\nempty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly\\r\\nbelieve that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became\\r\\nassured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down\\r\\nto Clerval.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I\\r\\nwas unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my\\r\\nflesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was\\r\\nunable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the\\r\\nchairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my\\r\\nunusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more\\r\\nattentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and\\r\\nmy loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh\\r\\nin that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw\\r\\nthe dreaded spectre glide into the room; “he can tell. Oh, save me! Save\\r\\nme!” I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down\\r\\nin a fit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated\\r\\nwith such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of\\r\\nhis grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several\\r\\nmonths. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned\\r\\nthat, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and\\r\\nhow wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by\\r\\nconcealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind\\r\\nand attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery,\\r\\nhe did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action\\r\\nthat he could towards them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\\r\\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of\\r\\nthe monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I\\r\\nraved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at\\r\\nfirst believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the\\r\\npertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him\\r\\nthat my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my\\r\\nfriend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing\\r\\noutward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves\\r\\nhad disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that\\r\\nshaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to\\r\\nmy convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my\\r\\nbosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before\\r\\nI was attacked by the fatal passion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This\\r\\nwhole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has\\r\\nbeen consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest\\r\\nremorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will\\r\\nforgive me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as\\r\\nfast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you\\r\\non one subject, may I not?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom\\r\\nI dared not even think?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not\\r\\nmention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy\\r\\nif they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know\\r\\nhow ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would\\r\\nnot fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving\\r\\nof my love?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a\\r\\nletter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I\\r\\nbelieve.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\r\\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own\\r\\nElizabeth:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dearest Cousin,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry\\r\\nare not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to\\r\\nwrite—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm\\r\\nour apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring\\r\\nthis line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a\\r\\njourney to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and\\r\\nperhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being\\r\\nable to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\\r\\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess\\r\\nyour wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor\\r\\ncousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting\\r\\nbetter. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own\\r\\nhandwriting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends\\r\\nwho love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see\\r\\nyou, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his\\r\\nbenevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of\\r\\nour Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous\\r\\nto be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with\\r\\nhim, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased\\r\\nwith the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had\\r\\nyour powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time\\r\\nis spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that\\r\\nhe will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on\\r\\nthe profession which he has selected.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place\\r\\nsince you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and\\r\\nI think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same\\r\\nimmutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am\\r\\nrewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.\\r\\nSince you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do\\r\\nyou remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you\\r\\ndo not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her\\r\\nmother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This\\r\\ngirl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange\\r\\nperversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz,\\r\\ntreated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years\\r\\nof age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The\\r\\nrepublican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier\\r\\nmanners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.\\r\\nHence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;\\r\\nand the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\\r\\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a\\r\\nservant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned\\r\\nthe duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not\\r\\ninclude the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you\\r\\nonce remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could\\r\\ndissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of\\r\\nAngelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great\\r\\nattachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior\\r\\nto that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine\\r\\nwas the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made\\r\\nany professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes\\r\\nthat she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in\\r\\nmany respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every\\r\\ngesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured\\r\\nto imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me\\r\\nof her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief\\r\\nto notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most\\r\\nanxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved\\r\\nfor her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception\\r\\nof her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was\\r\\ntroubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement\\r\\nfrom heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe\\r\\nher confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few\\r\\nmonths after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\\r\\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much\\r\\naltered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning\\r\\nmildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was\\r\\nher residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor\\r\\nwoman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to\\r\\nforgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the\\r\\ndeaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame\\r\\nMoritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\\r\\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the\\r\\nbeginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure\\r\\nyou I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty;\\r\\nas I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my\\r\\ndear aunt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.\\r\\nI wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue\\r\\neyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples\\r\\nappear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two\\r\\nlittle wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of\\r\\nfive years of age.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip\\r\\nconcerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already\\r\\nreceived the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young\\r\\nEnglishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard,\\r\\nthe rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has\\r\\nsuffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he\\r\\nhas already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of\\r\\nmarrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and\\r\\nmuch older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\\r\\neverybody.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns\\r\\nupon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a\\r\\nblessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection,\\r\\nand his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of\\r\\nyourself; and, I entreat you, write!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: “I will write\\r\\ninstantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and this\\r\\nexertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded\\r\\nregularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several\\r\\nprofessors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage,\\r\\nill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal\\r\\nnight, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had\\r\\nconceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I\\r\\nwas otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument\\r\\nwould renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had\\r\\nremoved all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\\r\\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been\\r\\nmy laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited\\r\\nthe professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and\\r\\nwarmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived\\r\\nthat I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my\\r\\nfeelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the\\r\\nscience itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\\r\\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed\\r\\ncarefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards\\r\\nused in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet\\r\\ndared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always\\r\\nquick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging,\\r\\nin excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.\\r\\nI thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he\\r\\nwas surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I\\r\\nloved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I\\r\\ncould never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often\\r\\npresent to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only\\r\\nimpress more deeply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost\\r\\ninsupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain\\r\\nthan the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he;\\r\\n“why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you\\r\\nplease; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago,\\r\\nbelieved in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself\\r\\nat the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all\\r\\nbe out of countenance.—Ay, ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of\\r\\nsuffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\\r\\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself\\r\\nwhen young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the\\r\\nconversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\\r\\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to\\r\\nthe university with the design of making himself complete master of the\\r\\noriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had\\r\\nmarked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his\\r\\neyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The\\r\\nPersian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily\\r\\ninduced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and\\r\\nnow that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\\r\\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only\\r\\ninstruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like\\r\\nhim, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate\\r\\nmaking any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to\\r\\nunderstand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is\\r\\nsoothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying\\r\\nthe authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\\r\\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair\\r\\nenemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly\\r\\nand heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for\\r\\nthe latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and\\r\\nsnow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded\\r\\nuntil the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see\\r\\nmy native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long,\\r\\nfrom an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\\r\\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\\r\\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its\\r\\nbeauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which\\r\\nwas to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in\\r\\nthe environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country\\r\\nI had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was\\r\\nfond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the\\r\\nramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long\\r\\nbeen restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I\\r\\nbreathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my\\r\\nfriend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my\\r\\nfellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better\\r\\nfeelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the\\r\\ncheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me,\\r\\nand endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A\\r\\nselfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\\r\\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a\\r\\nfew years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy,\\r\\ninanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful\\r\\nsensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present\\r\\nseason was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while\\r\\nthose of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during\\r\\nthe preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw\\r\\nthem off, with an invincible burden.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\\r\\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his\\r\\nsoul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his\\r\\nconversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the\\r\\nPersian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.\\r\\nAt other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments,\\r\\nwhich he supported with great ingenuity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing,\\r\\nand every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I\\r\\nbounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\r\\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Victor,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your\\r\\nreturn to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely\\r\\nmentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel\\r\\nkindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you\\r\\nexpected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and\\r\\nwretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have\\r\\nrendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my\\r\\nlong absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\\r\\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are\\r\\nto convey to you the horrible tidings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart,\\r\\nwho was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of\\r\\nthe transaction.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in\\r\\nPlainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther\\r\\nthan usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we\\r\\ndiscovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be\\r\\nfound. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently\\r\\nErnest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been\\r\\nplaying with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly\\r\\nsought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night\\r\\nfell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He\\r\\nwas not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I\\r\\nthought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps\\r\\nand dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the\\r\\nmorning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming\\r\\nand active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of\\r\\nthe murder’s finger was on his neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance\\r\\nbetrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At\\r\\nfirst I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where\\r\\nit lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands\\r\\nexclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling child!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived,\\r\\nit was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had\\r\\nteased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your\\r\\nmother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the\\r\\nmurderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our\\r\\nexertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved\\r\\nWilliam!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually,\\r\\nand accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my\\r\\nheart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you,\\r\\nmy son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now\\r\\nsay, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her\\r\\nyoungest darling!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but\\r\\nwith feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering,\\r\\nthe wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with\\r\\nkindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your\\r\\nenemies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\\r\\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\\n\\n\\r\\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to\\r\\nobserve the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving\\r\\nnews from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with\\r\\nmy hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with\\r\\nbitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in\\r\\nthe extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read\\r\\nthe account of my misfortune.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is\\r\\nirreparable. What do you intend to do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he\\r\\ncould only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, “dear\\r\\nlovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright\\r\\nand joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so\\r\\nmiserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How much more a murdered that could\\r\\ndestroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we;\\r\\nhis friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings\\r\\nare at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He\\r\\ncan no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\\r\\nsurvivors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed\\r\\nthemselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as\\r\\nsoon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to\\r\\nconsole and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew\\r\\nnear my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the\\r\\nmultitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes\\r\\nfamiliar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How\\r\\naltered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change\\r\\nhad taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees\\r\\nworked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might\\r\\nnot be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a\\r\\nthousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated\\r\\nthe lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains,\\r\\n“the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly\\r\\nscene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my\\r\\nnative town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the\\r\\nbright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. “Dear mountains! my own\\r\\nbeautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the\\r\\nsky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at\\r\\nmy unhappiness?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these\\r\\npreliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I\\r\\nthink of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native\\r\\ncan tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and,\\r\\nmore than all, thy lovely lake!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed\\r\\naround; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more\\r\\ngloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw\\r\\nobscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.\\r\\nAlas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in\\r\\nall the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of\\r\\nthe anguish I was destined to endure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of\\r\\nthe town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a\\r\\nvillage at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene;\\r\\nand, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor\\r\\nWilliam had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged\\r\\nto cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage\\r\\nI saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful\\r\\nfigures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a\\r\\nlow hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were\\r\\nclouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its\\r\\nviolence quickly increased.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased\\r\\nevery minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was\\r\\nechoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of\\r\\nlightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast\\r\\nsheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness,\\r\\nuntil the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often\\r\\nthe case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\\r\\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake\\r\\nwhich lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another\\r\\nstorm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes\\r\\ndisclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a\\r\\nhasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands,\\r\\nand exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy\\r\\ndirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole\\r\\nfrom behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could\\r\\nnot be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered\\r\\nits shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect\\r\\nmore hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the\\r\\nwretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he\\r\\nbe (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did\\r\\nthat idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\\r\\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\\r\\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\\r\\nhave destroyed the fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt\\r\\nit. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I\\r\\nthought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another\\r\\nflash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular\\r\\nascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon\\r\\nreached the summit, and disappeared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and\\r\\nthe scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the\\r\\nevents which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress\\r\\ntoward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside;\\r\\nits departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he\\r\\nfirst received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose\\r\\ninto the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had\\r\\nhe not murdered my brother?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night,\\r\\nwhich I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the\\r\\ninconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and\\r\\ndespair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with\\r\\nthe will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had\\r\\nnow done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from\\r\\nthe grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and\\r\\nI hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew\\r\\nof the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I\\r\\nreflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed,\\r\\nand endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an\\r\\ninaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had\\r\\nbeen seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an\\r\\nair of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if\\r\\nany other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it\\r\\nas the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would\\r\\nelude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives\\r\\nto commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a\\r\\ncreature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These\\r\\nreflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the\\r\\nservants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their\\r\\nusual hour of rising.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\\r\\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure\\r\\nfor Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed\\r\\non the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an\\r\\nhistorical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline\\r\\nBeaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her\\r\\ngarb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and\\r\\nbeauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a\\r\\nminiature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was\\r\\nthus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome\\r\\nme: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three\\r\\nmonths ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come\\r\\nto us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence\\r\\nwill, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and\\r\\nyour persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting\\r\\nself-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept\\r\\nover my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated\\r\\nhome; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I\\r\\ntried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I\\r\\nnamed my cousin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of\\r\\nhaving caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But\\r\\nsince the murderer has been discovered—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to\\r\\npursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or\\r\\nconfine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but\\r\\nto us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it\\r\\nat first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the\\r\\nevidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and\\r\\nfond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so\\r\\nappalling a crime?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully;\\r\\nevery one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost\\r\\nforced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to\\r\\nadd to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.\\r\\nBut she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been\\r\\ndiscovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several\\r\\ndays. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the\\r\\napparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket\\r\\nthe picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the\\r\\nmurderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without\\r\\nsaying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their\\r\\ndeposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor\\r\\ngirl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\\r\\nearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good\\r\\nJustine, is innocent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his\\r\\ncountenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had\\r\\nexchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than\\r\\nthat of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says\\r\\nthat he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had rather have\\r\\nbeen for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude\\r\\nin one I valued so highly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried\\r\\ntoday, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and\\r\\nindeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear,\\r\\ntherefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong\\r\\nenough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding\\r\\nhorror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist,\\r\\nexcept I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in\\r\\nthe existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I\\r\\nhad let loose upon the world?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her;\\r\\nit had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.\\r\\nThere was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an\\r\\nexpression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the\\r\\ngreatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with\\r\\nhope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.\\r\\nAlas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as\\r\\ncertainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not\\r\\nonly lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love,\\r\\nis to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall\\r\\nknow joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be\\r\\nhappy again, even after the sad death of my little William.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear\\r\\nnothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that\\r\\nmade me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else\\r\\nprejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She\\r\\nwept.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe,\\r\\ninnocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall\\r\\nprevent the slightest shadow of partiality.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\r\\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to commence.\\r\\nMy father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I\\r\\naccompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of\\r\\njustice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of\\r\\nmy curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow\\r\\nbeings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more\\r\\ndreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the\\r\\nmurder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed\\r\\nqualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be\\r\\nobliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather\\r\\nwould I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\\r\\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been\\r\\nconsidered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who\\r\\nsuffered through me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her\\r\\ncountenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings,\\r\\nexquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not\\r\\ntremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness\\r\\nwhich her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of\\r\\nthe spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have\\r\\ncommitted. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained;\\r\\nand as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\\r\\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she\\r\\nthrew her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear\\r\\nseemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a\\r\\nlook of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge,\\r\\nseveral witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,\\r\\nwhich might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I\\r\\nhad. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been\\r\\ncommitted and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from\\r\\nthe spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The\\r\\nwoman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only\\r\\nreturned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about\\r\\neight o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\\r\\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if\\r\\nanything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into\\r\\nviolent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then\\r\\nproduced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a\\r\\nfaltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child\\r\\nhad been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and\\r\\nindignation filled the court.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\\r\\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.\\r\\nSometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she\\r\\ncollected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that\\r\\nmy protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple\\r\\nexplanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the\\r\\ncharacter I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable\\r\\ninterpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the\\r\\nevening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an\\r\\naunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return,\\r\\nat about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of\\r\\nthe child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several\\r\\nhours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was\\r\\nforced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage,\\r\\nbeing unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of\\r\\nthe night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept\\r\\nfor a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and\\r\\nshe quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If\\r\\nshe had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.\\r\\nThat she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not\\r\\nsurprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William\\r\\nwas yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one\\r\\ncircumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when\\r\\nI have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning\\r\\nthe probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here\\r\\nalso I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely\\r\\nwould have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it\\r\\nthere? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why\\r\\nshould he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I\\r\\nbeg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if\\r\\ntheir testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned,\\r\\nalthough I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke\\r\\nwell of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty\\r\\nrendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this\\r\\nlast resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to\\r\\nfail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to\\r\\naddress the court.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather\\r\\nhis sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since\\r\\nand even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to\\r\\ncome forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish\\r\\nthrough the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak,\\r\\nthat I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the\\r\\naccused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at\\r\\nanother for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the\\r\\nmost amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein,\\r\\nmy aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and\\r\\nafterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that\\r\\nexcited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\\r\\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached\\r\\nto the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate\\r\\nmother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the\\r\\nevidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She\\r\\nhad no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof\\r\\nrests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to\\r\\nher, so much do I esteem and value her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal, but it\\r\\nwas excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on\\r\\nwhom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with\\r\\nthe blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not\\r\\nanswer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I\\r\\nbelieved in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\\r\\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the\\r\\ninnocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation,\\r\\nand when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges\\r\\nhad already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.\\r\\nThe tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence,\\r\\nbut the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court;\\r\\nmy lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was\\r\\nknown, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been\\r\\nthrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced\\r\\nsensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate\\r\\nexpressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair\\r\\nthat I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine\\r\\nhad already confessed her guilt. “That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly\\r\\nrequired in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our\\r\\njudges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\\r\\ndecisive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes\\r\\ndeceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be\\r\\nif I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and\\r\\nElizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had\\r\\nrather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But\\r\\nshe has confessed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\\r\\nJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I ever again believe in human\\r\\ngoodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on\\r\\nthose smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any\\r\\nseverity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\\r\\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\\r\\njudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth, “I will go, although\\r\\nshe is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.” The\\r\\nidea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw\\r\\nat the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.\\r\\nShe rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw\\r\\nherself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied\\r\\non your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so\\r\\nmiserable as I am now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with\\r\\nmy enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her voice was suffocated\\r\\nwith sobs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I\\r\\nam not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every\\r\\nevidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report,\\r\\nyou say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my\\r\\nconfidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain\\r\\nabsolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other\\r\\nsins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor\\r\\nhas besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that\\r\\nI was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell\\r\\nfire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to\\r\\nsupport me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What\\r\\ncould I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\\r\\nmiserable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my sweet lady,\\r\\nthat you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly\\r\\nhonoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but\\r\\nthe devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child!\\r\\nI soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that\\r\\nconsoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you\\r\\nconfess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will\\r\\nprove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears\\r\\nand prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister,\\r\\nperish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a\\r\\nmisfortune.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJustine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang\\r\\nis past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I\\r\\nleave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one\\r\\nunjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear\\r\\nlady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I\\r\\ncould conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of\\r\\nthat? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between\\r\\nlife and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my\\r\\nteeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.\\r\\nJustine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear\\r\\nsir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am\\r\\nguilty?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of\\r\\nyour innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he\\r\\ndid not credit it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude\\r\\ntowards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of\\r\\nothers to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune, and I\\r\\nfeel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you,\\r\\ndear lady, and your cousin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained\\r\\nthe resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying\\r\\nworm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also\\r\\nwept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a\\r\\ncloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its\\r\\nbrightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I\\r\\nbore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours\\r\\nwith Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\\r\\nherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live\\r\\nin this world of misery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her\\r\\nbitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed\\r\\nemotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend;\\r\\nmay heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last\\r\\nmisfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to\\r\\nmove the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly\\r\\nsufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I\\r\\nreceived their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these\\r\\nmen, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a\\r\\nmadman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\\r\\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\\r\\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father’s woe,\\r\\nand the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my\\r\\nthrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last\\r\\ntears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your\\r\\nlamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your\\r\\nkinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of\\r\\nblood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is\\r\\nmirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings\\r\\nand spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears;\\r\\nhappy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the\\r\\ndestruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad\\r\\ntorments!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I\\r\\nbeheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine,\\r\\nthe first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\r\\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been\\r\\nworked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and\\r\\ncertainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine\\r\\ndied, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a\\r\\nweight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.\\r\\nSleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed\\r\\ndeeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded\\r\\nmyself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of\\r\\nvirtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\\r\\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\r\\nNow all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to\\r\\nlook back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather\\r\\npromise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which\\r\\nhurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely\\r\\nrecovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all\\r\\nsound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only\\r\\nconsolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and\\r\\nhabits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene\\r\\nconscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the\\r\\ncourage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. “Do you think, Victor,”\\r\\nsaid he, “that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I\\r\\nloved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but is it not a duty\\r\\nto the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an\\r\\nappearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for\\r\\nexcessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of\\r\\ndaily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have\\r\\nbeen the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not\\r\\nmingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I\\r\\ncould only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself\\r\\nfrom his view.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\\r\\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten\\r\\no’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had\\r\\nrendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now\\r\\nfree. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the\\r\\nboat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was\\r\\ncarried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I\\r\\nleft the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable\\r\\nreflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the\\r\\nonly unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\\r\\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted\\r\\ncroaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted\\r\\nto plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my\\r\\ncalamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and\\r\\nsuffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in\\r\\nmine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base\\r\\ndesertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I\\r\\nhad let loose among them?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind\\r\\nonly that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be.\\r\\nRemorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils,\\r\\nand I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate\\r\\nsome new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he\\r\\nwould still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost\\r\\nefface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as\\r\\nanything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be\\r\\nconceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed,\\r\\nand I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly\\r\\nbestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge\\r\\nburst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest\\r\\npeak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I\\r\\nwished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on\\r\\nhis head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply shaken by\\r\\nthe horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no\\r\\nlonger took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her\\r\\nsacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just\\r\\ntribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer\\r\\nthat happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the\\r\\nlake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those\\r\\nsorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its\\r\\ndimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of Justine\\r\\nMoritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.\\r\\nBefore, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books\\r\\nor heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they\\r\\nwere remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery\\r\\nhas come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s\\r\\nblood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be\\r\\nguilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered,\\r\\nassuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the\\r\\nsake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a\\r\\nchild whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had\\r\\nbeen her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but\\r\\ncertainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society\\r\\nof men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the\\r\\nsame opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so\\r\\nlike the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I\\r\\nwere walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding\\r\\nand endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\\r\\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and\\r\\nperhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for\\r\\nthe same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in\\r\\neffect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and\\r\\nkindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These\\r\\nevents have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you\\r\\nare. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your\\r\\ncountenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.\\r\\nRemember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we\\r\\nlost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to\\r\\neach other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may\\r\\nreap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift\\r\\nof fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she\\r\\nspoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the\\r\\ndestroyer had been near to rob me of her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven,\\r\\ncould redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was\\r\\nencompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The\\r\\nwounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze\\r\\nupon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\\r\\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\\r\\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It\\r\\nwas during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my\\r\\nsteps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity\\r\\nof such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My\\r\\nwanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it\\r\\nfrequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a\\r\\nwreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a\\r\\nmule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these\\r\\nrugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of\\r\\nAugust, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from\\r\\nwhich I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I\\r\\nplunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices\\r\\nthat overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks,\\r\\nand the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\\r\\nOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than\\r\\nthat which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most\\r\\nterrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more\\r\\nmagnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices\\r\\nof piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there\\r\\npeeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it\\r\\nwas augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining\\r\\npyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the\\r\\nhabitations of another race of beings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river forms,\\r\\nopened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon\\r\\nafter, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and\\r\\nsublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which\\r\\nI had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries,\\r\\nbut I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers\\r\\napproached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\\r\\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont\\r\\nBlanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous\\r\\ndôme overlooked the valley.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\\r\\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\\r\\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\\r\\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents,\\r\\nand maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence\\r\\nceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the\\r\\nmisery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the\\r\\nworld, my fears, and more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I\\r\\nalighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the\\r\\nextreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space\\r\\nof time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played\\r\\nabove Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its\\r\\nnoisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen\\r\\nsensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt\\r\\nit as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\r\\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the\\r\\nsources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow\\r\\npace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.\\r\\nThe abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier\\r\\noverhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn\\r\\nsilence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by\\r\\nthe brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\\r\\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated\\r\\nice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon\\r\\nrent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime\\r\\nand magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable\\r\\nof receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although\\r\\nthey did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some\\r\\ndegree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded\\r\\nfor the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited\\r\\non and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had\\r\\ncontemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy\\r\\nmountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine,\\r\\nthe eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be\\r\\nat peace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled\\r\\nwith sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in\\r\\ntorrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw\\r\\nnot the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil\\r\\nand seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule\\r\\nwas brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.\\r\\nI remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier\\r\\nhad produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a\\r\\nsublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the\\r\\nobscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature\\r\\nhad indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget\\r\\nthe passing cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\\r\\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\\r\\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\\r\\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It\\r\\nis a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter\\r\\navalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground,\\r\\nsome entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the\\r\\nmountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is\\r\\nintersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above;\\r\\none of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even\\r\\nspeaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\\r\\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant,\\r\\nbut they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the\\r\\nvalley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and\\r\\ncurling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid\\r\\nin the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the\\r\\nmelancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man\\r\\nboast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\\r\\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst,\\r\\nand desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that\\r\\nblows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\\r\\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\\r\\nIt is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The path of its departure still is free.\\r\\nMan’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Nought may endure but mutability!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat\\r\\nupon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the\\r\\nsurrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended\\r\\nupon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a\\r\\ntroubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The\\r\\nfield of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in\\r\\ncrossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side\\r\\nwhere I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\\r\\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the\\r\\nrock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the\\r\\nvast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits\\r\\nhung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight\\r\\nover the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with\\r\\nsomething like joy; I exclaimed, “Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and\\r\\ndo not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as\\r\\nyour companion, away from the joys of life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\\r\\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the\\r\\nice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he\\r\\napproached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my\\r\\neyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold\\r\\ngale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous\\r\\nand abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage\\r\\nand horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal\\r\\ncombat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with\\r\\ndisdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too\\r\\nhorrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at\\r\\nfirst deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with\\r\\nwords expressive of furious detestation and contempt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce\\r\\nvengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or\\r\\nrather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the\\r\\nextinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so\\r\\ndiabolically murdered!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the wretched; how,\\r\\nthen, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my\\r\\ncreator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only\\r\\ndissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare\\r\\nyou sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards\\r\\nyou and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will\\r\\nleave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death,\\r\\nuntil it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a\\r\\nvengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation,\\r\\ncome on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently\\r\\nbestowed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which\\r\\ncan arm one being against the existence of another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe easily eluded me and said,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my\\r\\ndevoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?\\r\\nLife, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I\\r\\nwill defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my\\r\\nheight is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted\\r\\nto set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild\\r\\nand docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the\\r\\nwhich thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and\\r\\ntrample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and\\r\\naffection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy\\r\\nAdam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no\\r\\nmisdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I\\r\\nwas benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall\\r\\nagain be virtuous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we\\r\\nare enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must\\r\\nfall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye\\r\\nupon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me,\\r\\nFrankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I\\r\\nnot alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather\\r\\nfrom your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The\\r\\ndesert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many\\r\\ndays; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\\r\\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are\\r\\nkinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my\\r\\nexistence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.\\r\\nShall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies.\\r\\nI am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power\\r\\nto recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you\\r\\nto make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others,\\r\\nshall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\\r\\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that,\\r\\nabandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The\\r\\nguilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own\\r\\ndefence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of\\r\\nmurder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own\\r\\ncreature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me;\\r\\nlisten to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your\\r\\nhands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of which I\\r\\nshudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be\\r\\nthe day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse\\r\\nmyself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond\\r\\nexpression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or\\r\\nnot. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before\\r\\nmy eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight\\r\\nwhich you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By\\r\\nthe virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is\\r\\nlong and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine\\r\\nsensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the\\r\\nheavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and\\r\\nilluminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you\\r\\nit rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\\r\\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own\\r\\nspeedy ruin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full,\\r\\nand I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments\\r\\nthat he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly\\r\\nurged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto\\r\\nsupposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a\\r\\nconfirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what\\r\\nthe duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render\\r\\nhim happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to\\r\\ncomply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the\\r\\nopposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\\r\\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and\\r\\ndepressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire\\r\\nwhich my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\r\\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my\\r\\nbeing; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange\\r\\nmultiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the\\r\\nsame time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish\\r\\nbetween the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger\\r\\nlight pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness\\r\\nthen came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening\\r\\nmy eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I\\r\\nbelieve, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\\r\\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or\\r\\nsight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles\\r\\nwhich I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more\\r\\noppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where\\r\\nI could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by\\r\\nthe side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger\\r\\nand thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries\\r\\nwhich I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\\r\\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were,\\r\\ninstinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment,\\r\\non a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were\\r\\ninsufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless,\\r\\nmiserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain\\r\\ninvade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\\r\\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.\\r\\n[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened\\r\\nmy path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under\\r\\none of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat\\r\\ndown upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I\\r\\nfelt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my\\r\\nears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\\r\\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly\\r\\nlessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I\\r\\ngradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the\\r\\ntrees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first\\r\\ndiscovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from\\r\\nthe throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light\\r\\nfrom my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that\\r\\nsurrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which\\r\\ncanopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but\\r\\nwas unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\\r\\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form,\\r\\nshowed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this\\r\\ntime become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes\\r\\nbecame accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I\\r\\ndistinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.\\r\\nI found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the\\r\\nblackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by\\r\\nsome wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I\\r\\nexperienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but\\r\\nquickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the\\r\\nsame cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of\\r\\nthe fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected\\r\\nsome branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and\\r\\nsat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed\\r\\nnear the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by\\r\\ntouching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\\r\\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful\\r\\nsupply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the\\r\\ngreatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with\\r\\ndry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my\\r\\ncloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I\\r\\nuncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed\\r\\nthis also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they\\r\\nwere nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that\\r\\nthe fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was\\r\\nuseful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had\\r\\nleft had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered\\r\\nfrom the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner,\\r\\nplacing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\\r\\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in\\r\\nvain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I\\r\\nresolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where\\r\\nthe few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration\\r\\nI exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through\\r\\naccident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious\\r\\nconsideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt\\r\\nto supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\\r\\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length\\r\\ndiscovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night\\r\\nbefore, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was\\r\\ndisconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that\\r\\ncovered the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at\\r\\nlength I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been\\r\\nbuilt for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I\\r\\nexamined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered.\\r\\nAn old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.\\r\\nHe turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting\\r\\nthe hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\\r\\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before\\r\\nseen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the\\r\\nappearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground\\r\\nwas dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as\\r\\nPandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake\\r\\nof fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which\\r\\nconsisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not\\r\\nlike. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone\\r\\nbrightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and,\\r\\ndepositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I\\r\\nproceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a\\r\\nvillage. How miraculous did this appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and\\r\\nstately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens,\\r\\nthe milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages,\\r\\nallured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly\\r\\nplaced my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the\\r\\nwomen fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me,\\r\\nuntil, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\\r\\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite\\r\\nbare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the\\r\\nvillage. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant\\r\\nappearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.\\r\\nMy place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with\\r\\ndifficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which\\r\\nformed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by\\r\\ninnumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however\\r\\nmiserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity\\r\\nof man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the\\r\\nadjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.\\r\\nIt was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides\\r\\nwhich were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open,\\r\\nand by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be\\r\\nperceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\\r\\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that\\r\\nwas sufficient for me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired,\\r\\nfor I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my\\r\\ntreatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however,\\r\\nprovided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I\\r\\npurloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my\\r\\nhand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little\\r\\nraised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney\\r\\nof the cottage it was tolerably warm.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should\\r\\noccur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to\\r\\nthe bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank\\r\\nearth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to\\r\\nprocure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small\\r\\nchink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my\\r\\nhovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since\\r\\nfound cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\\r\\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was\\r\\nplaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and\\r\\nin about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now\\r\\npartly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the\\r\\nburden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.\\r\\nUttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head\\r\\nand bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared.\\r\\nPresently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the\\r\\nfield behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house\\r\\nand sometimes in the yard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had\\r\\nformerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In\\r\\none of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye\\r\\ncould just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible,\\r\\nwhitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small\\r\\nfire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.\\r\\nThe young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took\\r\\nsomething out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside\\r\\nthe old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds\\r\\nsweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight,\\r\\neven to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver\\r\\nhair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while\\r\\nthe gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\\r\\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which\\r\\nthe old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few\\r\\nsounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised\\r\\nher and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a\\r\\npeculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure,\\r\\nsuch as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or\\r\\nfood; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of\\r\\nwood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and\\r\\ntaking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and\\r\\nthe youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf\\r\\nand a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some\\r\\nroots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She\\r\\nafterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and\\r\\nappeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been\\r\\nemployed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\\r\\ncottage together.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his\\r\\ncompanions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal\\r\\nwas quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the\\r\\ncottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes,\\r\\nleaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast\\r\\nbetween these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a\\r\\ncountenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and\\r\\ngraceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry,\\r\\nyet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old\\r\\nman returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he\\r\\nhad used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers\\r\\nhad a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find\\r\\nthat the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in\\r\\nwatching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion\\r\\nwere employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old\\r\\nman again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had\\r\\nenchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not\\r\\nto play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\\r\\nharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found\\r\\nthat he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or\\r\\nletters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished\\r\\ntheir lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\r\\n“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the\\r\\nday. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I\\r\\nlonged to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had\\r\\nsuffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever\\r\\ncourse of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the\\r\\npresent I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to\\r\\ndiscover the motives which influenced their actions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged\\r\\nthe cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young\\r\\nman was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious\\r\\noccupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed\\r\\nhis leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed\\r\\nthe love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their\\r\\nvenerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of\\r\\naffection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent\\r\\nsmiles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart\\r\\nand appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply\\r\\naffected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange\\r\\nthat I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these\\r\\ngentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my\\r\\neyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious\\r\\nviands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\\r\\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of\\r\\naffection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express\\r\\npain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention\\r\\nand time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the\\r\\nuneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil\\r\\nin a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the\\r\\nvegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little\\r\\nduring the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.\\r\\nThey often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially\\r\\nthe two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\\r\\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the\\r\\nnight, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found\\r\\nthat in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied\\r\\nmyself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their\\r\\nlabours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting\\r\\nwood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use\\r\\nof which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the\\r\\nconsumption of several days.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened\\r\\nthe door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of\\r\\nwood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth\\r\\njoined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did\\r\\nnot go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and\\r\\ncultivating the garden.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these\\r\\npeople possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one\\r\\nanother by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes\\r\\nproduced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of\\r\\nthe hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to\\r\\nbecome acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this\\r\\npurpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having\\r\\nany apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue\\r\\nby which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application,\\r\\nhowever, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of\\r\\nthe moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the\\r\\nmost familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, fire,\\r\\nmilk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers\\r\\nthemselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the\\r\\nold man had only one, which was father. The girl was called\\r\\nsister or Agatha, and the youth Felix, brother, or\\r\\nson. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas\\r\\nappropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I\\r\\ndistinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or\\r\\napply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy.\\n\\n\\r\\n“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the\\r\\ncottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt\\r\\ndepressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human\\r\\nbeings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their\\r\\nharsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of\\r\\nmy friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his\\r\\nchildren, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their\\r\\nmelancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness\\r\\nthat bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes\\r\\nsometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;\\r\\nbut I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\\r\\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix.\\r\\nHe was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he\\r\\nappeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance\\r\\nwas more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister,\\r\\nespecially when he addressed the old man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the\\r\\ndispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,\\r\\nFelix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that\\r\\npeeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had\\r\\nrisen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house,\\r\\ndrew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his\\r\\nperpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\\r\\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer,\\r\\nbecause he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no\\r\\nwood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little\\r\\nto do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered\\r\\nthat he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I\\r\\nconjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he\\r\\nunderstood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that\\r\\npossible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as\\r\\nsigns? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to\\r\\nfollow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the\\r\\nendeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover\\r\\nmyself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first\\r\\nbecome master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\\r\\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\\r\\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and\\r\\ndelicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a\\r\\ntransparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed\\r\\nI who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was\\r\\nin reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of\\r\\ndespondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal\\r\\neffects of this miserable deformity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I\\r\\nbeheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more\\r\\nemployed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.\\r\\nTheir food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they\\r\\nprocured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the\\r\\ngarden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the\\r\\nseason advanced.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not\\r\\nrain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This\\r\\nfrequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season\\r\\nbecame far more pleasant than it had been.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the\\r\\nmotions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations,\\r\\nI slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they\\r\\nhad retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went\\r\\ninto the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I\\r\\nreturned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and\\r\\nperformed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that\\r\\nthese labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\\r\\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit,\\r\\nwonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and\\r\\nfeelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix\\r\\nappeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it\\r\\nmight be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I\\r\\nslept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle\\r\\nAgatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as\\r\\nsuperior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my\\r\\nimagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their\\r\\nreception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\\r\\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\\r\\nafterwards their love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the\\r\\nacquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and\\r\\nalthough my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I\\r\\npronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass\\r\\nand the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate,\\r\\nalthough his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and\\r\\nexecration.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of\\r\\nthe earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves\\r\\ndispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The\\r\\nbirds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the\\r\\ntrees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time\\r\\nbefore, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the\\r\\nenchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the\\r\\npresent was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and\\r\\nanticipations of joy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\r\\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that\\r\\nimpressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It\\r\\nsurprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the\\r\\nmost beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a\\r\\nthousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from\\r\\nlabour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that\\r\\nI observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed\\r\\nfrequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his\\r\\nmanner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a\\r\\ncheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady\\r\\nwas dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a\\r\\nquestion, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent,\\r\\nthe name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my\\r\\nfriends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she\\r\\nsaw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and\\r\\nexpression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes\\r\\nwere dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion,\\r\\nand her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow\\r\\nvanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of\\r\\nwhich I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek\\r\\nflushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the\\r\\nstranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from\\r\\nher lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and\\r\\ncalled her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not\\r\\nappear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\\r\\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took\\r\\nplace between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s\\r\\nfeet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her\\r\\naffectionately.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and\\r\\nappeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor\\r\\nherself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not\\r\\ncomprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage,\\r\\ndispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed\\r\\npeculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the\\r\\never-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to\\r\\nher brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful\\r\\nuntil she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\\r\\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by\\r\\nthe frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them,\\r\\nthat she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly\\r\\noccurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.\\r\\nThe stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them,\\r\\nindeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated\\r\\nFelix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night sweet Safie.’ He\\r\\nsat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition\\r\\nof her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their\\r\\nconversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty\\r\\ntowards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations\\r\\nof Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking\\r\\nhis guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew\\r\\ntears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a\\r\\nrich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined\\r\\nit. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but\\r\\nunlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and\\r\\nsaid some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he\\r\\nappeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by\\r\\nher music.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy\\r\\nhad taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always\\r\\ngay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that\\r\\nin two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green\\r\\nbanks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes,\\r\\nstars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the\\r\\nnights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to\\r\\nme, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early\\r\\nrising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of\\r\\nmeeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village\\r\\nwhich I entered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the\\r\\nlanguage; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who\\r\\nunderstood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended\\r\\nand could imitate almost every word that was spoken.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was\\r\\ntaught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and\\r\\ndelight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s Ruins of\\r\\nEmpires. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\\r\\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work,\\r\\nhe said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern\\r\\nauthors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view\\r\\nof the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight\\r\\ninto the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the\\r\\nearth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental\\r\\nactivity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early\\r\\nRomans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire,\\r\\nof chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American\\r\\nhemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original\\r\\ninhabitants.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed,\\r\\nat once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He\\r\\nappeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all\\r\\nthat can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man\\r\\nappeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and\\r\\nvicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a\\r\\ncondition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long\\r\\ntime I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\\r\\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and\\r\\nbloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I\\r\\nlistened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange\\r\\nsystem of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of\\r\\nproperty, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble\\r\\nblood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions\\r\\nmost esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united\\r\\nwith riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but\\r\\nwithout either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond\\r\\nand a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And\\r\\nwhat was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew\\r\\nthat I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\\r\\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the\\r\\nsame nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser\\r\\ndiet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my\\r\\nstature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like\\r\\nme. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and\\r\\nwhom all men disowned?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I\\r\\ntried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had\\r\\nfor ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations\\r\\nof hunger, thirst, and heat!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once\\r\\nseized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all\\r\\nthought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the\\r\\nsensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not\\r\\nunderstand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and\\r\\namiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with\\r\\nthem, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\\r\\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming\\r\\none among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the\\r\\ncharming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the\\r\\nlively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy\\r\\nwretch!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\\r\\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted\\r\\non the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all\\r\\nthe life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how\\r\\nthe mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all\\r\\nthe various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual\\r\\nbonds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days,\\r\\nno mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past\\r\\nlife was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my\\r\\nearliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had\\r\\nnever yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.\\r\\nWhat was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return\\r\\nto the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of\\r\\nindignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love\\r\\nand reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful\\r\\nself-deceit, to call them).”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\r\\n“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which\\r\\ncould not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a\\r\\nnumber of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly\\r\\ninexperienced as I was.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in\\r\\nFrance, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his\\r\\nsuperiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his\\r\\ncountry, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few\\r\\nmonths before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called\\r\\nParis, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue,\\r\\nrefinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could\\r\\nafford.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish\\r\\nmerchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I\\r\\ncould not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast\\r\\ninto prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He\\r\\nwas tried and condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very\\r\\nflagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and\\r\\nwealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his\\r\\ncondemnation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation\\r\\nwere uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that\\r\\nmoment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. After\\r\\nmany fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly\\r\\ngrated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon\\r\\nof the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\\r\\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made\\r\\nknown to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and\\r\\ndelighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of\\r\\nreward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the\\r\\nlovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures\\r\\nexpressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind\\r\\nthat the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and\\r\\nhazard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the\\r\\nheart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by\\r\\nthe promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place\\r\\nof safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward\\r\\nto the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the\\r\\nescape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he\\r\\nreceived from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the\\r\\nlanguage of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who\\r\\nunderstood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended\\r\\nservices towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own\\r\\nfate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the\\r\\nhovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the\\r\\nhands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give them to you; they will\\r\\nprove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined,\\r\\nI shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by\\r\\nthe Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of\\r\\nSafie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of\\r\\nher mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now\\r\\nreduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught\\r\\nher to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit\\r\\nforbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons\\r\\nwere indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of\\r\\nagain returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed\\r\\nonly to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of\\r\\nher soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The\\r\\nprospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were\\r\\nallowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to\\r\\nit he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from\\r\\nParis. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and\\r\\nhimself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the\\r\\ndeceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed\\r\\nhimself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to\\r\\nLeghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of\\r\\npassing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure,\\r\\nbefore which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his\\r\\ndeliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in\\r\\nthe meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him\\r\\nthe simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through\\r\\nthe means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks;\\r\\nand Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the\\r\\nyouthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed\\r\\nthe idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the\\r\\nresentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still\\r\\nin the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian\\r\\nstate which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be\\r\\nenabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\\r\\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were\\r\\nfacilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim\\r\\nand spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was\\r\\nquickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news\\r\\nreached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged\\r\\nfather and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free\\r\\nair and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He\\r\\nquickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable\\r\\nopportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain\\r\\nas a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he\\r\\nhastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping\\r\\nto free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial\\r\\ntook place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned\\r\\nthem to a perpetual exile from their native country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered\\r\\nthem. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family\\r\\nendured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus\\r\\nreduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and\\r\\nhad quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of\\r\\nmoney to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when\\r\\nI first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured\\r\\npoverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in\\r\\nit; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were\\r\\nmisfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused\\r\\nnew life into his soul.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank,\\r\\nthe merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to\\r\\nprepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was\\r\\noutraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he\\r\\nleft her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her\\r\\nhastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been\\r\\ndivulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government;\\r\\nhe had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which\\r\\ncity he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the\\r\\ncare of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part\\r\\nof his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would\\r\\nbecome her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to\\r\\nher; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. By some papers of\\r\\nher father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and\\r\\nlearnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but\\r\\nat length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that\\r\\nbelonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a\\r\\nnative of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and\\r\\ndeparted for Germany.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De\\r\\nLacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most\\r\\ndevoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone,\\r\\nunacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the\\r\\ncustoms of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had\\r\\nmentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death\\r\\nthe woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should\\r\\narrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\r\\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I\\r\\nlearned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their\\r\\nvirtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were\\r\\never present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the\\r\\nbusy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.\\r\\nBut in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a\\r\\ncircumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\\r\\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the\\r\\nground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some\\r\\nbooks. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately\\r\\nthe books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at\\r\\nthe cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch’s\\r\\nLives, and the Sorrows of Werter. The possession of these treasures\\r\\ngave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon\\r\\nthese histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an\\r\\ninfinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but\\r\\nmore frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the Sorrows of\\r\\nWerter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many\\r\\nopinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to\\r\\nme obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and\\r\\nastonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty\\r\\nsentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self,\\r\\naccorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\\r\\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine\\r\\nbeing than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no\\r\\npretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were\\r\\ncalculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits\\r\\nof the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction\\r\\nI wept, without precisely understanding it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\\r\\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the\\r\\nbeings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I\\r\\nsympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was\\r\\ndependent on none and related to none. ‘The path of my departure was free,’ and\\r\\nthere was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature\\r\\ngigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What\\r\\nwas my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\\r\\nsolve them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The volume of Plutarch’s Lives which I possessed contained the\\r\\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far\\r\\ndifferent effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from\\r\\nWerter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high\\r\\nthoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to\\r\\nadmire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my\\r\\nunderstanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide\\r\\nextents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly\\r\\nunacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my\\r\\nprotectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but\\r\\nthis book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\\r\\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest\\r\\nardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I\\r\\nunderstood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I\\r\\napplied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of\\r\\ncourse led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in\\r\\npreference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors\\r\\ncaused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first\\r\\nintroduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory\\r\\nand slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it,\\r\\nas I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true\\r\\nhistory. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an\\r\\nomnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often\\r\\nreferred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like\\r\\nAdam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but\\r\\nhis state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth\\r\\nfrom the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the\\r\\nespecial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire\\r\\nknowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and\\r\\nalone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\\r\\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of\\r\\nenvy rose within me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my\\r\\narrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which\\r\\nI had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I\\r\\nwas able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to\\r\\nstudy them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded\\r\\nmy creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the\\r\\nprogress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\\r\\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is\\r\\nrelated in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail\\r\\nof that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view;\\r\\nthe minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in\\r\\nlanguage which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened\\r\\nas I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed\\r\\ncreator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from\\r\\nme in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\\r\\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very\\r\\nresemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage\\r\\nhim, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I\\r\\ncontemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent\\r\\ndispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with\\r\\nmy admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my\\r\\npersonal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who\\r\\nsolicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to\\r\\ndespair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would\\r\\ndecide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the\\r\\nimportance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\\r\\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s\\r\\nexperience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more\\r\\nmonths should have added to my sagacity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of\\r\\nSafie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater\\r\\ndegree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement\\r\\nand conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not\\r\\nappear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and\\r\\npeaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge\\r\\nonly discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished\\r\\nhope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or\\r\\nmy shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which\\r\\nin a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts,\\r\\nunchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy\\r\\namiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my\\r\\ngloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was\\r\\nall a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I\\r\\nremembered Adam’s supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had\\r\\nabandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall,\\r\\nand nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I\\r\\nfirst beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of\\r\\nthe weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold\\r\\nthan heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and\\r\\nall the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more\\r\\nattention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\\r\\nabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys,\\r\\ndepending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place\\r\\naround them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim\\r\\ntheir protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these\\r\\namiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection\\r\\nwas the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn\\r\\nthem from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\\r\\nnever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little\\r\\nfood or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself\\r\\nutterly unworthy of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place\\r\\nsince I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely directed towards\\r\\nmy plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved\\r\\nmany projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when\\r\\nthe blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the\\r\\nunnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those\\r\\nwho had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in\\r\\nit; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\\r\\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be\\r\\ntolerated by my younger protectors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and\\r\\ndiffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix\\r\\ndeparted on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left\\r\\nalone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and\\r\\nplayed several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever\\r\\nheard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure,\\r\\nbut as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying\\r\\naside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide\\r\\nmy hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.\\r\\nAll was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet,\\r\\nwhen I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the\\r\\nground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master,\\r\\nremoved the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.\\r\\nThe fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door\\r\\nof their cottage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am a traveller in want of a\\r\\nlittle rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few\\r\\nminutes before the fire.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your\\r\\nwants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am\\r\\nafraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest\\r\\nonly that I need.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me,\\r\\nyet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the\\r\\nold man addressed me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.\\r\\nI am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love,\\r\\nand of whose favour I have some hopes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Are they Germans?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and\\r\\ndeserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.\\r\\nThese amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. I\\r\\nam full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts\\r\\nof men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly\\r\\nlove and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good\\r\\nand amiable, do not despair.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but,\\r\\nunfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my\\r\\nlife has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal\\r\\nprejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind\\r\\nfriend, they behold only a detestable monster.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you\\r\\nundeceive them?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so\\r\\nmany overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to\\r\\nthem, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but\\r\\nthey believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish\\r\\nto overcome.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Near this spot.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly confide to me\\r\\nthe particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am\\r\\nblind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your\\r\\nwords which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it\\r\\nwill afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from\\r\\nthe dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven\\r\\nfrom the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you\\r\\nto desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and\\r\\nmy family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not\\r\\nfeel for your misfortunes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I\\r\\nheard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful;\\r\\nand your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on\\r\\nthe point of meeting.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of\\r\\nor bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient\\r\\nto answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on\\r\\nthe chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger\\r\\nprotectors. I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I\\r\\ncried, ‘Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the\\r\\nfriends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha\\r\\nentered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?\\r\\nAgatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the\\r\\ncottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his\\r\\nfather, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the\\r\\nground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from\\r\\nlimb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with\\r\\nbitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow,\\r\\nwhen, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\\r\\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\r\\n“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not\\r\\nextinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know\\r\\nnot; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage\\r\\nand revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its\\r\\ninhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no\\r\\nlonger restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in\\r\\nfearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying\\r\\nthe objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like\\r\\nswiftness. Oh! What a miserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in\\r\\nmockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the\\r\\nsweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I,\\r\\nwere at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me,\\r\\nand finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\\r\\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the\\r\\nruin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued\\r\\nwith excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence\\r\\nof despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity\\r\\nor assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that\\r\\nmoment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all,\\r\\nagainst him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to\\r\\nreturn to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick\\r\\nunderwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my\\r\\nsituation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of\\r\\ntranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not\\r\\nhelp believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had certainly\\r\\nacted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the\\r\\nfather in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror\\r\\nof his children. I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by\\r\\ndegrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should\\r\\nhave been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\\r\\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\\r\\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep;\\r\\nbut the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.\\r\\nThe horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the\\r\\nfemales were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father’s feet. I\\r\\nawoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my\\r\\nhiding-place, and went in search of food.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path\\r\\nthat conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel\\r\\nand remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family\\r\\narose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers\\r\\ndid not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.\\r\\nThe inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe\\r\\nthe agony of this suspense.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered\\r\\ninto conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what\\r\\nthey said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that\\r\\nof my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was\\r\\nsurprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and\\r\\nwaited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual\\r\\nappearances.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that you will be obliged to pay\\r\\nthree months’ rent and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to\\r\\ntake any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to\\r\\nconsider of your determination.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your\\r\\ncottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful\\r\\ncircumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from\\r\\ntheir horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of\\r\\nyour tenement and let me fly from this place.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the\\r\\ncottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never\\r\\nsaw any of the family of De Lacey more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and\\r\\nstupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that\\r\\nheld me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred\\r\\nfilled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to\\r\\nbe borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I\\r\\nthought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of\\r\\nAgatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a\\r\\ngush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\\r\\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure\\r\\nanything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced,\\r\\nI placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having\\r\\ndestroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced\\r\\nimpatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\\r\\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along\\r\\nlike a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that\\r\\nburst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree\\r\\nand danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the\\r\\nwestern horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb\\r\\nwas at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I\\r\\nfired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned\\r\\nthe fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to\\r\\nit and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the\\r\\nhabitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved\\r\\nto fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised,\\r\\nevery country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed my\\r\\nmind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to\\r\\nwhom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among\\r\\nthe lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted;\\r\\nI had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of\\r\\nthe earth. You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and\\r\\ntowards this place I resolved to proceed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly\\r\\ndirection to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide. I did not\\r\\nknow the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask\\r\\ninformation from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only\\r\\ncould I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of\\r\\nhatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and\\r\\npassions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\\r\\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined\\r\\nto seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that\\r\\nwore the human form.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in\\r\\nautumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled\\r\\nonly at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature\\r\\ndecayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me;\\r\\nmighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and\\r\\nbare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on\\r\\nthe cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me\\r\\nwas turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation,\\r\\nthe more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\\r\\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and\\r\\nthen directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered\\r\\nwide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident\\r\\noccurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a\\r\\ncircumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when\\r\\nthe sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green,\\r\\nconfirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by\\r\\nnight from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay\\r\\nthrough a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen;\\r\\nthe day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the\\r\\nloveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of\\r\\ngentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half\\r\\nsurprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away\\r\\nby them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft\\r\\ntears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\\r\\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary,\\r\\nwhich was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent\\r\\ntheir branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly\\r\\nknowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me\\r\\nto conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young\\r\\ngirl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she\\r\\nran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\\r\\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid\\r\\nstream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force\\r\\nof the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I\\r\\nendeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was\\r\\nsuddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person\\r\\nfrom whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and\\r\\ntearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I\\r\\nfollowed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he\\r\\naimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and\\r\\nmy injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from\\r\\ndestruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a\\r\\nwound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and\\r\\ngentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to\\r\\nhellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred\\r\\nand vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses\\r\\npaused, and I fainted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the\\r\\nwound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not\\r\\nwhether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of\\r\\nextracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the\\r\\ninjustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a\\r\\ndeep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and\\r\\nanguish I had endured.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I\\r\\nendured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of\\r\\nspring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me\\r\\nfeel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached\\r\\nthe environs of Geneva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the\\r\\nfields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was\\r\\noppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes\\r\\nof evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains\\r\\nof Jura.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was\\r\\ndisturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the\\r\\nrecess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed\\r\\non him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had\\r\\nlived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I\\r\\ncould seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so\\r\\ndesolate in this peopled earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards\\r\\nme. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and\\r\\nuttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said,\\r\\n‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish\\r\\nto eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my\\r\\npapa.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will\\r\\npunish you. You dare not keep me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn\\r\\neternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to\\r\\nmy heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at\\r\\nmy feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\\r\\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation; my enemy\\r\\nis not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other\\r\\nmiseries shall torment and destroy him.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I\\r\\ntook it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it\\r\\nsoftened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark\\r\\neyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage\\r\\nreturned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such\\r\\nbeautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated\\r\\nwould, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\\r\\nexpressive of disgust and affright.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that\\r\\nat that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I\\r\\ndid not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed\\r\\nthe murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which\\r\\nhad appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was\\r\\nyoung, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an\\r\\nagreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I\\r\\nthought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.\\r\\nAnd then I bent over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he\\r\\nwho would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\\r\\nbeloved, awake!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed\\r\\nawake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she\\r\\nassuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was\\r\\nmadness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the\\r\\nmurder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give\\r\\nme, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!\\r\\nThanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned\\r\\nnow to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one\\r\\nof the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes\\r\\nwishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for\\r\\never. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through\\r\\ntheir immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can\\r\\ngratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.\\r\\nI am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed\\r\\nand horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of\\r\\nthe same species and have the same defects. This being you must create.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\r\\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a\\r\\nreply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas\\r\\nsufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of\\r\\nthose sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it\\r\\nof you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away\\r\\nwhile he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I\\r\\ncould no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from\\r\\nme. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me\\r\\nbase in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint\\r\\nwickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may\\r\\ntorture me, but I will never consent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead of threatening, I am\\r\\ncontent to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not\\r\\nshunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and\\r\\ntriumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities\\r\\nme? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those\\r\\nice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man\\r\\nwhen he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and\\r\\ninstead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude\\r\\nat his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable\\r\\nbarriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.\\r\\nI will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\\r\\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\\r\\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\\r\\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your\\r\\nbirth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into\\r\\ncontortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed\\r\\nhimself and proceeded—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not\\r\\nreflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions\\r\\nof benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold;\\r\\nfor that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now\\r\\nindulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is\\r\\nreasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as\\r\\nmyself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it\\r\\nshall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world;\\r\\nbut on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will\\r\\nnot be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.\\r\\nOh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one\\r\\nbenefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not\\r\\ndeny me my request!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my\\r\\nconsent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and\\r\\nthe feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations,\\r\\nand did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in\\r\\nmy power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again;\\r\\nI will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do\\r\\nnot destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford\\r\\nme sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself\\r\\nand will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves;\\r\\nthe sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I\\r\\npresent to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it\\r\\nonly in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards\\r\\nme, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and\\r\\npersuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in\\r\\nthose wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can\\r\\nyou, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You\\r\\nwill return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their\\r\\ndetestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a\\r\\ncompanion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to\\r\\nargue the point, for I cannot consent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my\\r\\nrepresentations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear\\r\\nto you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the\\r\\ncompanion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may\\r\\nchance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I\\r\\nshall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying\\r\\nmoments I shall not curse my maker.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt\\r\\na wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass\\r\\nthat moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those\\r\\nof horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I\\r\\ncould not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small\\r\\nportion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree\\r\\nof malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a\\r\\nfeint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your\\r\\nrevenge?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no\\r\\nties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another\\r\\nwill destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose\\r\\nexistence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced\\r\\nsolitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in\\r\\ncommunion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and\\r\\nbecome linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now\\r\\nexcluded.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments\\r\\nwhich he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had\\r\\ndisplayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all\\r\\nkindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested\\r\\ntowards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a\\r\\ncreature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from\\r\\npursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing\\r\\nfaculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection I\\r\\nconcluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of\\r\\nme that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and\\r\\nevery other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into\\r\\nyour hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the\\r\\nfire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist\\r\\nyou shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours;\\r\\nI shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that\\r\\nwhen you are ready I shall appear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my\\r\\nsentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight\\r\\nof an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the\\r\\nhorizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the\\r\\nvalley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy,\\r\\nand my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain\\r\\nand fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the\\r\\nemotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced\\r\\nwhen I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.\\r\\nThe stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark\\r\\npines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground;\\r\\nit was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I\\r\\nwept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! stars and\\r\\nclouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush\\r\\nsensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and\\r\\nleave me in darkness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the\\r\\neternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every\\r\\nblast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest,\\r\\nbut returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no\\r\\nexpression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain’s weight and\\r\\ntheir excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and\\r\\nentering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild\\r\\nappearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I\\r\\nspeak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim\\r\\ntheir sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet\\r\\neven thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\\r\\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every\\r\\nother circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought\\r\\nonly had to me the reality of life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\r\\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could\\r\\nnot collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the\\r\\ndisappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task\\r\\nwhich was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again\\r\\ndevoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had\\r\\nheard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the\\r\\nknowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of\\r\\nobtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\\r\\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking\\r\\nwhose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed\\r\\nhad taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much\\r\\nrestored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise,\\r\\nrose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his\\r\\nthoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\\r\\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness\\r\\novercast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most\\r\\nperfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat,\\r\\nwatching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and\\r\\nlistless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some\\r\\ndegree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with\\r\\na readier smile and a more cheerful heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me\\r\\naside, thus addressed me,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures\\r\\nand seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still\\r\\navoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of\\r\\nthis, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you\\r\\nto avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down\\r\\ntreble misery on us all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our\\r\\ndear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining\\r\\nyears. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied\\r\\ntogether, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one\\r\\nanother. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the\\r\\nbest assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard\\r\\nher as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you\\r\\nmay have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound\\r\\nin honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which\\r\\nyou appear to feel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I\\r\\nnever saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and\\r\\naffection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the\\r\\nexpectation of our union.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me\\r\\nmore pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall\\r\\nassuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is\\r\\nthis gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I\\r\\nwish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate\\r\\nsolemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have\\r\\ndrawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.\\r\\nYou are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\\r\\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of\\r\\nhonour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I\\r\\nwish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me\\r\\nany serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I\\r\\nconjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of\\r\\noffering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and\\r\\nendeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an immediate\\r\\nunion with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn\\r\\npromise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what\\r\\nmanifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter\\r\\ninto a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me\\r\\nto the ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his\\r\\nmate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I\\r\\nexpected peace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England\\r\\nor entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country\\r\\nwhose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present\\r\\nundertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was\\r\\ndilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the\\r\\nidea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house while in\\r\\nhabits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand\\r\\nfearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\\r\\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I should often\\r\\nlose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that\\r\\nwould possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent\\r\\nmyself from all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly\\r\\nbe achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My\\r\\npromise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy\\r\\nimaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\\r\\nslavery for ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit\\r\\nEngland, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires\\r\\nunder a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an\\r\\nearnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of\\r\\nan absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he\\r\\nwas glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a\\r\\njourney, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before\\r\\nmy return, have restored me entirely to myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most\\r\\na year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken\\r\\nto ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he\\r\\nhad, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at\\r\\nStrasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of\\r\\nmy task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could\\r\\nin no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved\\r\\nmany hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me\\r\\nand the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his\\r\\nabhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with\\r\\nElizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered\\r\\nhim extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised\\r\\nmyself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings;\\r\\nit was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I\\r\\nmight claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled\\r\\nme with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends\\r\\nunconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks,\\r\\nexasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me\\r\\nwherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination\\r\\nwas dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my\\r\\nfriends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\\r\\nthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of\\r\\nmy creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and\\r\\nmy present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and\\r\\nexempt my family from the danger of his machinations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.\\r\\nMy journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but\\r\\nshe was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the\\r\\ninroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion\\r\\nin Clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call\\r\\nforth a woman’s sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a\\r\\nthousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful,\\r\\nsilent farewell.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing\\r\\nwhither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered\\r\\nonly, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my\\r\\nchemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary\\r\\nimaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes\\r\\nwere fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels and\\r\\nthe work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many\\r\\nleagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came.\\r\\nAlas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene,\\r\\njoyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he\\r\\nbeheld it rise and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting\\r\\ncolours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to\\r\\nlive,” he cried; “now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein,\\r\\nwherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\\r\\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise\\r\\nreflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the\\r\\njournal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and\\r\\ndelight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by\\r\\na curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam,\\r\\nwhence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed many\\r\\nwillowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Mannheim,\\r\\nand on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The\\r\\ncourse of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river\\r\\ndescends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful\\r\\nforms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices,\\r\\nsurrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine,\\r\\nindeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged\\r\\nhills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine\\r\\nrushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards\\r\\nwith green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the\\r\\nscene.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as\\r\\nwe glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\\r\\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\\r\\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink\\r\\nin a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my\\r\\nsensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been\\r\\ntransported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. “I have\\r\\nseen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited\\r\\nthe lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost\\r\\nperpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which\\r\\nwould cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant\\r\\nislands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake\\r\\nagitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you\\r\\nan idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash\\r\\nwith fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were\\r\\noverwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be\\r\\nheard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La\\r\\nValais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than\\r\\nall those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange,\\r\\nbut there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw\\r\\nequalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on\\r\\nthe island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\\r\\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half\\r\\nhid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and\\r\\nguards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the\\r\\nglacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own\\r\\ncountry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to\\r\\ndwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being\\r\\nformed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination\\r\\nwas chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent\\r\\naffections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the\\r\\nworldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human\\r\\nsympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of\\r\\nexternal nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with\\r\\nardour:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n——The sounding cataract\\r\\nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\\r\\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\r\\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to him\\r\\nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,\\r\\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\\r\\nBy thought supplied, or any interest\\r\\nUnborrow’d from the eye.\\n\\r\\n[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has\\r\\nthis mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which\\r\\nformed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this\\r\\nmind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your\\r\\nform so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit\\r\\nstill visits and consoles your unhappy friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to\\r\\nthe unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the\\r\\nanguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post\\r\\nthe remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river\\r\\nwas too gentle to aid us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\\r\\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It\\r\\nwas on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the\\r\\nwhite cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they\\r\\nwere flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of\\r\\nsome story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend,\\r\\nWoolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard of even in my country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering above\\r\\nall, and the Tower famed in English history.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\r\\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in\\r\\nthis wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men\\r\\nof genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a\\r\\nsecondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the\\r\\ninformation necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed\\r\\nmyself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to\\r\\nthe most distinguished natural philosophers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would\\r\\nhave afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my\\r\\nexistence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they\\r\\nmight give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.\\r\\nCompany was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of\\r\\nheaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself\\r\\ninto a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back\\r\\ndespair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\\r\\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and\\r\\nto reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with\\r\\nanguish.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and\\r\\nanxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he\\r\\nobserved was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He\\r\\nwas also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit\\r\\nIndia, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and\\r\\nin the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the\\r\\nprogress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further\\r\\nthe execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\\r\\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much\\r\\nas possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who\\r\\nwas entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter\\r\\nrecollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement,\\r\\nthat I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary\\r\\nfor my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of\\r\\nwater continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was\\r\\nan extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my\\r\\nlips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\\r\\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties\\r\\nof his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to\\r\\ninduce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.\\r\\nClerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred\\r\\nsociety, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works\\r\\nwith which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.\\r\\nWe accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the\\r\\nexpiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the\\r\\ngreat road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the\\r\\nCumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the\\r\\nend of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had\\r\\ncollected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern\\r\\nhighlands of Scotland.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor,\\r\\nrambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the\\r\\nmajestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all\\r\\nnovelties to us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were\\r\\nfilled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more\\r\\nthan a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his\\r\\nforces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had\\r\\nforsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory\\r\\nof that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent\\r\\nGoring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city\\r\\nwhich they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found\\r\\na dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had\\r\\nnot found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in\\r\\nitself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and\\r\\npicturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which\\r\\nflows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a\\r\\nplacid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and\\r\\nspires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of\\r\\nthe past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful\\r\\nhappiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I\\r\\nwas ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or\\r\\nthe study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could\\r\\nalways interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a\\r\\nblasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should\\r\\nsurvive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of\\r\\nwrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and\\r\\nendeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating\\r\\nepoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged\\r\\nby the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the\\r\\nillustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my\\r\\nsoul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the\\r\\ndivine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the\\r\\nmonuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\\r\\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my\\r\\nflesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place\\r\\nof rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a\\r\\ngreater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale,\\r\\nand the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on\\r\\nthe piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the\\r\\nlittle cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the\\r\\nsame manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made\\r\\nme tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which\\r\\nthat terrible scene was thus associated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and\\r\\nWestmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The\\r\\nlittle patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the\\r\\nmountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar\\r\\nand dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost\\r\\ncontrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably\\r\\ngreater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he\\r\\nfound in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\\r\\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I\\r\\ncould pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should\\r\\nscarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its\\r\\nenjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to\\r\\nsink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in\\r\\npleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also\\r\\nhe forsakes for other novelties.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and\\r\\nconceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our\\r\\nappointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.\\r\\nFor my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time,\\r\\nand I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in\\r\\nSwitzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me and\\r\\ntormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose\\r\\nand peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were\\r\\ndelayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived\\r\\nand I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read\\r\\nand ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might\\r\\nexpedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed\\r\\nme, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to\\r\\nprotect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had\\r\\ncommitted some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was\\r\\nguiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal\\r\\nas that of crime.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have\\r\\ninterested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as\\r\\nOxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the\\r\\nbeauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its\\r\\nenvirons, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well,\\r\\nand the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with\\r\\ncheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination\\r\\nof my journey. \\n\\r\\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and along\\r\\nthe banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no\\r\\nmood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans\\r\\nwith the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that\\r\\nI wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself,\\r\\nand let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not\\r\\ninterfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a\\r\\nshort time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\\r\\ncongenial to your own temper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\\r\\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he\\r\\nsaid, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not\\r\\nknow; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself\\r\\nsomewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\\r\\nScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster\\r\\nfollowed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that\\r\\nhe might receive his companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the\\r\\nremotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for\\r\\nsuch a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually\\r\\nbeaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a\\r\\nfew miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five\\r\\npersons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.\\r\\nVegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh\\r\\nwater, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles\\r\\ndistant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was\\r\\nvacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these\\r\\nexhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had\\r\\nfallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I\\r\\nordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an\\r\\nincident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the\\r\\nsenses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I\\r\\nlived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and\\r\\nclothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\\r\\nof men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the\\r\\nweather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the\\r\\nwaves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet\\r\\never-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this\\r\\ndesolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its\\r\\ncottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and\\r\\ngentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of\\r\\na lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I\\r\\nproceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.\\r\\nSometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several\\r\\ndays, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.\\r\\nIt was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first\\r\\nexperiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my\\r\\nemployment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my\\r\\neyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold\\r\\nblood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a\\r\\nsolitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual\\r\\nscene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and\\r\\nnervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my\\r\\neyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the\\r\\nobject which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of\\r\\nmy fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.\\r\\nI looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared\\r\\nnot trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings\\r\\nof evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\r\\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\\r\\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\\r\\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour\\r\\nfor the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I\\r\\nsat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects\\r\\nof what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner\\r\\nand had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and\\r\\nfilled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another\\r\\nbeing of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand\\r\\ntimes more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and\\r\\nwretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in\\r\\ndeserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a\\r\\nthinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made\\r\\nbefore her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already\\r\\nlived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\\r\\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\\r\\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he\\r\\nbe again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one\\r\\nof his own species.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEven if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet\\r\\none of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would\\r\\nbe children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might\\r\\nmake the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full\\r\\nof terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon\\r\\neverlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I\\r\\nhad created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for\\r\\nthe first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to\\r\\nthink that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not\\r\\nhesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the\\r\\nwhole human race.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the\\r\\nlight of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips\\r\\nas he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.\\r\\nYes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself\\r\\nin caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my\\r\\nprogress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and\\r\\ntreachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating\\r\\nanother like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on\\r\\nwhich I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future\\r\\nexistence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and\\r\\nrevenge, withdrew.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never\\r\\nto resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own\\r\\napartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me\\r\\nfrom the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was\\r\\nalmost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the\\r\\neye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now\\r\\nand then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called\\r\\nto one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its\\r\\nextreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars\\r\\nnear the shore, and a person landed close to my house.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\\r\\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\\r\\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in\\r\\na cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of\\r\\nhelplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to\\r\\nfly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened,\\r\\nand the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me and\\r\\nsaid in a smothered voice,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do\\r\\nyou dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery; I left\\r\\nSwitzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow\\r\\nislands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the\\r\\nheaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured\\r\\nincalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself,\\r\\nequal in deformity and wickedness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my\\r\\ncondescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but\\r\\nI can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You\\r\\nare my creator, but I am your master; obey!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.\\r\\nYour threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in\\r\\na determination of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool\\r\\nblood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and\\r\\nwretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\\r\\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and\\r\\neach beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they\\r\\nwere requited by detestation and scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your\\r\\nhours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must\\r\\nravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in\\r\\nthe intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\\r\\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first\\r\\nyou, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.\\r\\nBeware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the\\r\\nwiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of\\r\\nthe injuries you inflict.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have\\r\\ndeclared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave\\r\\nme; I am inexorable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my death-warrant, be\\r\\nsure that you are yourself safe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\\r\\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the\\r\\nwaters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\\r\\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up\\r\\nand down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a\\r\\nthousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him and closed\\r\\nwith him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had\\r\\ndirected his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be the\\r\\nnext victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of\\r\\nhis words—“I will be with you on your wedding-night.” That, then, was\\r\\nthe period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die\\r\\nand at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to\\r\\nfear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless\\r\\nsorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears,\\r\\nthe first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not\\r\\nto fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\\r\\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the\\r\\ndepths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s\\r\\ncontention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an\\r\\ninsuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such\\r\\nshould prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on\\r\\nthat barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of\\r\\nmisery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most\\r\\nloved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved\\r\\nand miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher,\\r\\nI lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake\\r\\nthe whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed\\r\\nby watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when\\r\\nI awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself,\\r\\nand I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still\\r\\nthe words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a\\r\\ndream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\\r\\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\\r\\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it\\r\\ncontained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.\\r\\nHe said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that\\r\\nletters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete\\r\\nthe negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not\\r\\nany longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed,\\r\\neven sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to\\r\\nbestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me,\\r\\ntherefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might\\r\\nproceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I\\r\\ndetermined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to\\r\\nreflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must\\r\\nenter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle\\r\\nthose utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at\\r\\ndaybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.\\r\\nThe remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered\\r\\non the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human\\r\\nbeing. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling\\r\\nhand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought\\r\\nnot to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the\\r\\npeasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of\\r\\nstones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very\\r\\nnight; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and\\r\\narranging my chemical apparatus. \\n\\r\\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my\\r\\nfeelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded\\r\\nmy promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences,\\r\\nmust be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my\\r\\neyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours\\r\\ndid not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my\\r\\nthoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I\\r\\nhad resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first\\r\\nmade would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\\r\\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\\r\\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The\\r\\nscene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I\\r\\nsailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful\\r\\ncrime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow\\r\\ncreatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly\\r\\noverspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and\\r\\ncast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and\\r\\nthen sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but the air was pure,\\r\\nalthough chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed\\r\\nme and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my\\r\\nstay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself\\r\\nat the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I\\r\\nheard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur\\r\\nlulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found\\r\\nthat the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves\\r\\ncontinually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was\\r\\nnortheast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.\\r\\nI endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the\\r\\nattempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only\\r\\nresource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations\\r\\nof terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the\\r\\ngeography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I\\r\\nmight be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation\\r\\nor be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around\\r\\nme. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst,\\r\\na prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered\\r\\nby clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked\\r\\nupon the sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is\\r\\nalready fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval—all\\r\\nleft behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless\\r\\npassions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that\\r\\neven now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I\\r\\nshudder to reflect on it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\\r\\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from\\r\\nbreakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to\\r\\nhold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for\\r\\nseveral hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to\\r\\nmy heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of\\r\\nlife even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my\\r\\ndress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky\\r\\nappearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of\\r\\ncultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported\\r\\nback to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of\\r\\nthe land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small\\r\\npromontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail\\r\\ndirectly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure\\r\\nnourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I\\r\\nperceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart\\r\\nbounding with joy at my unexpected escape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people\\r\\ncrowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but\\r\\ninstead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at\\r\\nany other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it\\r\\nwas, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them\\r\\nin that language. “My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me\\r\\nthe name of this town and inform me where I am?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice. “Maybe you\\r\\nare come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be\\r\\nconsulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and\\r\\nI was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of\\r\\nhis companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not\\r\\nthe custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it\\r\\nis the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.\\r\\nTheir faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in\\r\\nsome degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I\\r\\nthen moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed\\r\\nand surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the\\r\\nshoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an\\r\\naccount of yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free\\r\\ncountry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are\\r\\nto give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last\\r\\nnight.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that\\r\\ncould easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was\\r\\nled to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and\\r\\nhunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my\\r\\nstrength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or\\r\\nconscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few\\r\\nmoments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of\\r\\nignominy or death.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the\\r\\nfrightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\r\\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent\\r\\nman with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of\\r\\nseverity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as\\r\\nwitnesses on this occasion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate,\\r\\nhe deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong\\r\\nnortherly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very\\r\\ndark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour,\\r\\nbut, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked\\r\\non first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed\\r\\nhim at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot\\r\\nagainst something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up\\r\\nto assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen\\r\\non the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition\\r\\nwas that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown\\r\\non shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not\\r\\nwet and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the\\r\\ncottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore\\r\\nit to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years\\r\\nof age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence\\r\\nexcept the black mark of fingers on his neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when\\r\\nthe mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and\\r\\nfelt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my\\r\\neyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed\\r\\nme with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he\\r\\nswore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat,\\r\\nwith a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he\\r\\ncould judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had\\r\\njust landed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of\\r\\nher cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she\\r\\nheard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it\\r\\npush off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body\\r\\ninto her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and\\r\\nDaniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that,\\r\\nwith the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very\\r\\nprobable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return\\r\\nnearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that\\r\\nit appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely\\r\\nthat as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour\\r\\nignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited\\r\\nthe corpse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the\\r\\nroom where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect\\r\\nthe sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the\\r\\nextreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been\\r\\ndescribed. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other\\r\\npersons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences\\r\\nthat had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been\\r\\nconversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time\\r\\nthat the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences\\r\\nof the affair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I\\r\\ndescribe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can\\r\\nI reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. The\\r\\nexamination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream\\r\\nfrom my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before\\r\\nme. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have my\\r\\nmurderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have\\r\\nalready destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my\\r\\nfriend, my benefactor—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was\\r\\ncarried out of the room in strong convulsions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\\r\\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of\\r\\nWilliam, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to\\r\\nassist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at\\r\\nothers I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed\\r\\naloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr.\\r\\nKirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to\\r\\naffright the other witnesses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink\\r\\ninto forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the\\r\\nonly hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have\\r\\nbeen one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and\\r\\nthe decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so\\r\\nmany shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the\\r\\ntorture?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a\\r\\ndream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers,\\r\\nturnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning,\\r\\nI remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars\\r\\nof what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly\\r\\noverwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the\\r\\nsqualidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I\\r\\ngroaned bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She\\r\\nwas a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance\\r\\nexpressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. The\\r\\nlines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see\\r\\nwithout sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire\\r\\nindifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that\\r\\nI had heard during my sufferings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it\\r\\nbe all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to\\r\\nfeel this misery and horror.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you\\r\\nmurdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy\\r\\nit will go hard with you! However, that’s none of my business; I am sent to\\r\\nnurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well\\r\\nif everybody did the same.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to\\r\\na person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable\\r\\nto reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me\\r\\nas a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never\\r\\npresented itself to my mind with the force of reality.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a\\r\\ndarkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle\\r\\nvoice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and prescribed\\r\\nmedicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was\\r\\nvisible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in\\r\\nthe visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but\\r\\nthe hangman who would gain his fee?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown\\r\\nme extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared\\r\\nfor me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a\\r\\nphysician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he\\r\\nardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not\\r\\nwish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came,\\r\\ntherefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short\\r\\nand with long intervals.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\\r\\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and\\r\\nmisery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a\\r\\nworld which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered\\r\\nwhether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law,\\r\\nless innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door\\r\\nof my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed\\r\\nsympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in\\r\\nFrench,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you\\r\\nmore comfortable?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth\\r\\nthere is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one\\r\\nborne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon\\r\\nquit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to\\r\\nfree you from the criminal charge.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most\\r\\nmiserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death\\r\\nbe any evil to me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange\\r\\nchances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising\\r\\naccident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and\\r\\ncharged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the\\r\\nbody of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it\\r\\nwere, by some fiend across your path.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this\\r\\nretrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge\\r\\nhe seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited\\r\\nin my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person\\r\\nwere brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which\\r\\nI could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I\\r\\nfound several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its\\r\\ncommencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two\\r\\nmonths have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now\\r\\nyou tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me\\r\\nwhat new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; “and someone,\\r\\na friend, is come to visit you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly\\r\\ndarted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt\\r\\nme with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his\\r\\nhellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding\\r\\nmy exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have\\r\\nbeen welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from\\r\\nanguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But\\r\\nwhere is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought\\r\\nthat my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he\\r\\ninstantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room with my\\r\\nnurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival\\r\\nof my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\\r\\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding\\r\\nspirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.\\r\\n“What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!” said he, looking mournfully at\\r\\nthe barred windows and wretched appearance of the room. “You travelled to seek\\r\\nhappiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be\\r\\nendured in my weak state; I shed tears.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind\\r\\nhangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on\\r\\nthe coffin of Henry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious\\r\\nstate of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure\\r\\ntranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be\\r\\nexhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like\\r\\nthat of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that\\r\\nnothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly\\r\\nand murdered. More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw\\r\\nme made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so\\r\\nmiserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny,\\r\\nwhich is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish\\r\\nthese throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me\\r\\nto the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.\\r\\nThen the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to\\r\\nmy thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for\\r\\nsome mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in\\r\\nprison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I\\r\\nwas obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the\\r\\ncourt was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting\\r\\nwitnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing\\r\\npublicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that\\r\\ndecides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being\\r\\nproved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was\\r\\nfound; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal\\r\\ncharge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted\\r\\nto return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings, for to\\r\\nme the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was\\r\\npoisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and\\r\\ngay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness,\\r\\npenetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.\\r\\nSometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the\\r\\ndark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\\r\\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw\\r\\nthem in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva,\\r\\nwhich I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew\\r\\ndeep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought\\r\\nwith melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring\\r\\nmaladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that\\r\\nhad been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was\\r\\na torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in\\r\\nnature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\\r\\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I\\r\\nloathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from\\r\\ncommitting some dreadful act of violence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over\\r\\nmy selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without delay to\\r\\nGeneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in\\r\\nwait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his\\r\\nconcealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with\\r\\nunfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had\\r\\nendued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired\\r\\nto delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\\r\\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My strength\\r\\nwas gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted\\r\\nframe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my\\r\\nfather thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound\\r\\nfor Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was\\r\\nmidnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing\\r\\nof the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my\\r\\npulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.\\r\\nThe past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in\\r\\nwhich I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the\\r\\nsea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision\\r\\nand that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me\\r\\nand the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my\\r\\nquiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my\\r\\nmother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad\\r\\nenthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called\\r\\nto mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of\\r\\nthought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every\\r\\nnight a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that\\r\\nI was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.\\r\\nOppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double\\r\\nmy usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me\\r\\nrespite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that\\r\\nscared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the\\r\\nfiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries\\r\\nrang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my\\r\\nrestlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above,\\r\\nthe fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was\\r\\nestablished between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future\\r\\nimparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its\\r\\nstructure peculiarly susceptible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\r\\nThe voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that\\r\\nI had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my\\r\\njourney. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not\\r\\nknow the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the\\r\\nincurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face\\r\\nof man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\\r\\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic\\r\\nnature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their\\r\\nintercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their\\r\\nblood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and\\r\\nhunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which\\r\\nhad their source in me!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various\\r\\narguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the\\r\\ndegradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured\\r\\nto prove to me the futility of pride.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their\\r\\nfeelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt\\r\\npride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered\\r\\nthe same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her.\\r\\nWilliam, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion;\\r\\nwhen I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and\\r\\nat others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that,\\r\\nduring my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my\\r\\nimagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I\\r\\navoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I\\r\\nhad created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in\\r\\nitself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring\\r\\nmyself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and\\r\\nmake fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore,\\r\\nmy impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the\\r\\nworld to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have\\r\\nrecorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of\\r\\nthem, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My\\r\\ndearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to\\r\\nmake such an assertion again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have\\r\\nviewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those\\r\\nmost innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I\\r\\nhave shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could\\r\\nnot, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged,\\r\\nand he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to\\r\\nalter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate\\r\\nthe memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to\\r\\nthem or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart,\\r\\nbut I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes;\\r\\nsufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence I\\r\\ncurbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare\\r\\nitself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than\\r\\nthey had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\\r\\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Friend,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at\\r\\nParis; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in\\r\\nless than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I\\r\\nexpect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This\\r\\nwinter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious\\r\\nsuspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your\\r\\nheart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year\\r\\nago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period,\\r\\nwhen so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my\\r\\nuncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we\\r\\nmeet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you\\r\\nreally say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. But you\\r\\nare distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased\\r\\nwith this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not\\r\\nany longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to\\r\\nexpress to you but have never had the courage to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your\\r\\nparents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to\\r\\nlook forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were\\r\\naffectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued\\r\\nfriends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often\\r\\nentertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more\\r\\nintimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer\\r\\nme, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love\\r\\nanother?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt;\\r\\nand I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy,\\r\\nflying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help\\r\\nsupposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in\\r\\nhonour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves\\r\\nto your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend,\\r\\nthat I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my\\r\\nconstant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\\r\\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable\\r\\nunless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think\\r\\nthat, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by\\r\\nthe word honour, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone\\r\\nrestore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may\\r\\nincrease your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor,\\r\\nbe assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to\\r\\nbe made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me\\r\\nin this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power\\r\\nto interrupt my tranquillity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day,\\r\\nor even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of\\r\\nyour health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned\\r\\nby this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\\n\\n\\r\\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the\\r\\nfiend—“I will be with you on your wedding-night!” Such was my sentence,\\r\\nand on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me\\r\\nfrom the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.\\r\\nOn that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be\\r\\nit so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\\r\\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were\\r\\nvanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant\\r\\nenjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt,\\r\\nhis lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone,\\r\\nbut free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a\\r\\ntreasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would\\r\\npursue me until death.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened\\r\\nfeelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love\\r\\nand joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me\\r\\nfrom all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his\\r\\nthreat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage\\r\\nwould hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner,\\r\\nbut if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his\\r\\nmenaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.\\r\\nHe had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, yet he did not consider\\r\\nthat threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\\r\\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after\\r\\nthe enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate\\r\\nunion with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my\\r\\nadversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\\r\\naffectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for\\r\\nus on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away\\r\\nyour idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for\\r\\ncontentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to\\r\\nyou, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised\\r\\nat my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will\\r\\nconfide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall\\r\\ntake place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.\\r\\nBut until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\\r\\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to Geneva.\\r\\nThe sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as\\r\\nshe beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also.\\r\\nShe was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before\\r\\ncharmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit\\r\\ncompanion for one blasted and miserable as I was.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\\r\\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me;\\r\\nsometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I\\r\\nneither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the\\r\\nmultitude of miseries that overcame me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\\r\\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings\\r\\nwhen sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she\\r\\nwould remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well\\r\\nfor the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The\\r\\nagonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in\\r\\nindulging the excess of grief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.\\r\\nI remained silent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.\\r\\nLet the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or\\r\\ndeath, to the happiness of my cousin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let\\r\\nus only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we\\r\\nhave lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by\\r\\nthe ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened\\r\\nyour despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of\\r\\nwhom we have been so cruelly deprived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat\\r\\nreturned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his\\r\\ndeeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had\\r\\npronounced the words “I shall be with you on your wedding-night,” I\\r\\nshould regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me\\r\\nif the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a\\r\\ncontented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my\\r\\ncousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put,\\r\\nas I imagined, the seal to my fate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGreat God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention\\r\\nof my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my\\r\\nnative country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have\\r\\nconsented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the\\r\\nmonster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had\\r\\nprepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a\\r\\nprophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings\\r\\nby an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of\\r\\nmy father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.\\r\\nShe looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a\\r\\nlittle fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared\\r\\ncertain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and\\r\\nleave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and\\r\\nall wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart\\r\\nthe anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the\\r\\nplans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my\\r\\ntragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth\\r\\nhad been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on the\\r\\nshores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our\\r\\nunion, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness\\r\\nbeside the beautiful lake near which it stood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend\\r\\nshould openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and\\r\\nwas ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater\\r\\ndegree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared\\r\\nmore as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the\\r\\nhappiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as\\r\\nthe day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually\\r\\nspoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her\\r\\nmind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was\\r\\nmelancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she\\r\\nthought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the\\r\\nfollowing day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of\\r\\npreparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a\\r\\nbride.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father’s, but it\\r\\nwas agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping\\r\\nthat night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was\\r\\nfair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of\\r\\nhappiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from\\r\\nits rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene,\\r\\nsometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks\\r\\nof Montalègre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc,\\r\\nand the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her;\\r\\nsometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark\\r\\nside to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\\r\\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what\\r\\nI have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste\\r\\nthe quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to\\r\\nenjoy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing to\\r\\ndistress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my\\r\\nheart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the\\r\\nprospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister\\r\\nvoice. Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes\\r\\nobscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of\\r\\nbeauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are\\r\\nswimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies\\r\\nat the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection\\r\\nupon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few\\r\\ninstants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and\\r\\nreverie.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its\\r\\npath through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The\\r\\nAlps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of\\r\\nmountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the\\r\\nwoods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it\\r\\nwas overhung.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at\\r\\nsunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a\\r\\npleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it\\r\\nwafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the\\r\\nhorizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears\\r\\nrevive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\r\\nIt was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore,\\r\\nenjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the\\r\\nlovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still\\r\\ndisplaying their black outlines.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the\\r\\nwest. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to\\r\\ndescend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and\\r\\ndimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens,\\r\\nrendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise.\\r\\nSuddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of\\r\\nobjects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while\\r\\nmy right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound\\r\\nterrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink\\r\\nfrom the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but\\r\\nthere was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\\r\\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it\\r\\nyou fear?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and all will be safe; but\\r\\nthis night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful\\r\\nthe combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly\\r\\nentreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some\\r\\nknowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the\\r\\nhouse and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.\\r\\nBut I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some\\r\\nfortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when\\r\\nsuddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which\\r\\nElizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my\\r\\narms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel\\r\\nthe blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.\\r\\nThis state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\\r\\ninto the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction\\r\\nof the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and\\r\\ninanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and\\r\\ndistorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same\\r\\nfigure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal\\r\\nbier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest\\r\\nwhere it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell\\r\\nsenseless on the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\\r\\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared\\r\\nonly as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from\\r\\nthem to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately\\r\\nliving, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had\\r\\nfirst beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief\\r\\nthrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed\\r\\ntowards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness\\r\\nof the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the\\r\\nElizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend’s\\r\\ngrasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The\\r\\nwindows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on\\r\\nseeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters\\r\\nhad been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw\\r\\nat the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the\\r\\nface of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed\\r\\ntowards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a\\r\\npistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and\\r\\nrunning with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot\\r\\nwhere he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast,\\r\\nbut in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my\\r\\ncompanions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After\\r\\nhaving landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different\\r\\ndirections among the woods and vines.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house,\\r\\nbut my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at\\r\\nlast in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was\\r\\nparched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried back and placed on\\r\\na bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room\\r\\nas if to seek something that I had lost.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where\\r\\nthe corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung over it\\r\\nand joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented\\r\\nitself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting\\r\\nconfusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of\\r\\nwonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder\\r\\nof Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only\\r\\nremaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\\r\\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This\\r\\nidea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to\\r\\nreturn to Geneva with all possible speed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\\r\\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly\\r\\nmorning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row and\\r\\ntook an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in\\r\\nbodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of\\r\\nagitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down\\r\\nthe oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that\\r\\narose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier\\r\\ntime and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who\\r\\nwas now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain\\r\\nhad ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done\\r\\na few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so\\r\\npainful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or\\r\\nthe clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day\\r\\nbefore. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no\\r\\ncreature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single\\r\\nin the history of man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming\\r\\nevent? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and\\r\\nwhat I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my\\r\\nfriends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted,\\r\\nand I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under\\r\\nthe tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! His\\r\\neyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his\\r\\nElizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection\\r\\nwhich a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings\\r\\nmore earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought\\r\\nmisery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not\\r\\nlive under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of\\r\\nexistence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few\\r\\ndays he died in my arms.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness\\r\\nwere the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I\\r\\nwandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth,\\r\\nbut I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees\\r\\nI gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released\\r\\nfrom my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\\r\\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to\\r\\nreason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes\\r\\npressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had\\r\\ncreated, the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my\\r\\ndestruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and\\r\\ndesired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a\\r\\ngreat and signal revenge on his cursed head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on\\r\\nthe best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my\\r\\nrelease, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an\\r\\naccusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required\\r\\nhim to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be assured, sir,”\\r\\nsaid he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the\\r\\nvillain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to\\r\\nmake. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it\\r\\nwere there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.\\r\\nThe story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for\\r\\nfalsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had\\r\\nformed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this\\r\\npurpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now\\r\\nrelated my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates\\r\\nwith accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he\\r\\nbecame more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror;\\r\\nat others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse and\\r\\nfor whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It\\r\\nis your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a\\r\\nman will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.\\r\\nHe had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of\\r\\nspirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially\\r\\nin consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however,\\r\\nanswered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but\\r\\nthe creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my\\r\\nexertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of\\r\\nice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides,\\r\\nsome months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can\\r\\nconjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has\\r\\nindeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and\\r\\ndestroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit\\r\\nmy narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is\\r\\nhis desert.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. “You are\\r\\nmistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the\\r\\nmonster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his\\r\\ncrimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties,\\r\\nthat this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is\\r\\npursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is\\r\\nof no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is\\r\\nthe devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I\\r\\nreflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.\\r\\nYou refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either\\r\\nin my life or death, to his destruction.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my\\r\\nmanner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the\\r\\nmartyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose\\r\\nmind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this\\r\\nelevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe\\r\\nme as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know\\r\\nnot what it is you say.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some\\r\\nother mode of action.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\r\\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up\\r\\nand lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength\\r\\nand composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm\\r\\nat periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was\\r\\nhappy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I\\r\\nprovided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had\\r\\nbelonged to my mother, and departed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed\\r\\na vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers\\r\\nin deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly\\r\\nknow; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and\\r\\nprayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my\\r\\nadversary in being.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might\\r\\ntrace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered\\r\\nmany hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.\\r\\nAs night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where\\r\\nWilliam, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb\\r\\nwhich marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the\\r\\ntrees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and\\r\\nthe scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\\r\\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a\\r\\nshadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage\\r\\nand despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to\\r\\ndestroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed\\r\\nthe earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I\\r\\nkneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I\\r\\nfeel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to\\r\\npursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal\\r\\nconflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear\\r\\nrevenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which\\r\\notherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of\\r\\nthe dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me\\r\\nin my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him\\r\\nfeel the despair that now torments me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\\r\\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the\\r\\nfuries possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It\\r\\nrang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if\\r\\nall hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I\\r\\nshould have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence\\r\\nbut that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter\\r\\ndied away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear,\\r\\naddressed me in an audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\\r\\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded\\r\\nmy grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his\\r\\nghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight\\r\\nclue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean\\r\\nappeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide\\r\\nhimself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same\\r\\nship, but he escaped, I know not how.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have\\r\\never followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid\\r\\napparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I\\r\\nlost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The\\r\\nsnows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white\\r\\nplain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown,\\r\\nhow can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue\\r\\nwere the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\\r\\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed\\r\\nand directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from\\r\\nseemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by\\r\\nhunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert\\r\\nthat restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the\\r\\npeasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the\\r\\nspirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens\\r\\ncloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky,\\r\\nshed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally\\r\\navoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly\\r\\ncollected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally\\r\\nsubsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and\\r\\ngained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me\\r\\nsome food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always\\r\\npresented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep\\r\\nalone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I\\r\\nsank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that\\r\\nguarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I\\r\\nmight retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I\\r\\nshould have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and\\r\\ninspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my\\r\\nbeloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the\\r\\nsilver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and\\r\\nyouth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was\\r\\ndreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the\\r\\narms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How\\r\\ndid I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking\\r\\nhours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance,\\r\\nthat burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\\r\\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical\\r\\nimpulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of\\r\\nmy soul.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left\\r\\nmarks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and\\r\\ninstigated my fury. “My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one\\r\\nof these inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek\\r\\nthe everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and\\r\\nfrost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow\\r\\nnot too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have\\r\\nyet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure\\r\\nuntil that period shall arrive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable\\r\\nfiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I\\r\\nperish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed\\r\\nfriends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible\\r\\npilgrimage!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\\r\\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut\\r\\nup in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize\\r\\nthe animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for\\r\\nprey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus\\r\\nI was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\\r\\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils only begin;\\r\\nwrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey\\r\\nwhere your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\\r\\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I\\r\\ncontinued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean\\r\\nappeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How\\r\\nunlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only\\r\\nto be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The\\r\\nGreeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia,\\r\\nand hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I\\r\\nknelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\\r\\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet\\r\\nand grapple with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\\r\\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend\\r\\npossessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost\\r\\nground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw\\r\\nthe ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him\\r\\nbefore he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on,\\r\\nand in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the\\r\\ninhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic\\r\\nmonster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many\\r\\npistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear\\r\\nof his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and\\r\\nplacing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of\\r\\ntrained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the\\r\\nhorror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction\\r\\nthat led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by\\r\\nthe breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had\\r\\nescaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across\\r\\nthe mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants\\r\\ncould long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could\\r\\nnot hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be\\r\\ntriumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed\\r\\nevery other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the\\r\\ndead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen\\r\\nOcean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery\\r\\nwhich nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my\\r\\nheart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice\\r\\noften barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea,\\r\\nwhich threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of\\r\\nthe sea secure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had\\r\\npassed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope,\\r\\nreturning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and\\r\\ngrief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should\\r\\nsoon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed\\r\\nme had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and\\r\\none, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with\\r\\nanguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I\\r\\nstrained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of\\r\\necstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a\\r\\nwell-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\\r\\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not\\r\\nintercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the\\r\\nburning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept\\r\\naloud.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead\\r\\ncompanion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour’s rest,\\r\\nwhich was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I\\r\\ncontinued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of\\r\\nit except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with\\r\\nits intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after\\r\\nnearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my\\r\\nheart bounded within me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly\\r\\nextinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done\\r\\nbefore. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters\\r\\nrolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I\\r\\npressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the\\r\\nmighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and\\r\\noverwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous\\r\\nsea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered\\r\\npiece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\\r\\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\\r\\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I\\r\\nhad no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the\\r\\nsight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these\\r\\nmeans was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction\\r\\nof your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust\\r\\nmyself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to\\r\\ninduce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your\\r\\ndirection was northwards. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted,\\r\\nand I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I\\r\\nstill dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow me the\\r\\nrest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me,\\r\\nWalton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my\\r\\nvengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage,\\r\\nto endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should\\r\\nconduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not\\r\\ntriumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark\\r\\ncrimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over\\r\\nmy heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of\\r\\ntreachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\\r\\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust\\r\\nyour sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWalton, in continuation.\\n\\n\\r\\nAugust 26th, 17—.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel\\r\\nyour blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?\\r\\nSometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others,\\r\\nhis voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete\\r\\nwith anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation,\\r\\nnow subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes\\r\\nhe commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents\\r\\nwith a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\\r\\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the\\r\\nwildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I\\r\\nown to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the\\r\\napparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater\\r\\nconviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however\\r\\nearnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot\\r\\ndoubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to\\r\\ngain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation, but on this\\r\\npoint he was impenetrable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your senseless curiosity\\r\\nlead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?\\r\\nPeace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to\\r\\nsee them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but\\r\\nprincipally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his\\r\\nenemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a\\r\\nmutilated one should go down to posterity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that\\r\\never imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been\\r\\ndrunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and\\r\\ngentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so\\r\\ninfinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh,\\r\\nno! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered\\r\\nspirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude\\r\\nand delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\\r\\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\\r\\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but\\r\\nthe beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This\\r\\nfaith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as\\r\\nimposing and interesting as truth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.\\r\\nOn every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a\\r\\nquick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor\\r\\ncan I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the\\r\\npassions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have\\r\\nbeen in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!\\r\\nHe seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.\\r\\nMy feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me\\r\\nfor illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature\\r\\nsupported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to\\r\\nthrow away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow\\r\\ncreatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the\\r\\ncreation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the\\r\\nherd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the\\r\\ncommencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All\\r\\nmy speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to\\r\\nomnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my\\r\\npowers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these\\r\\nqualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I\\r\\ncannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I\\r\\ntrod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the\\r\\nidea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\\r\\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was,\\r\\nyou would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely\\r\\nvisited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never,\\r\\nnever again to rise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\\r\\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas\\r\\nI have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value\\r\\nand lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable\\r\\na wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that\\r\\nany can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any\\r\\nwoman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by\\r\\nany superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a\\r\\ncertain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They\\r\\nknow our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards\\r\\nmodified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\\r\\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother\\r\\ncan never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other\\r\\nof fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be\\r\\nattached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I\\r\\nenjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their\\r\\nown merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the\\r\\nconversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and\\r\\nbut one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\\r\\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility\\r\\nto my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my\\r\\ndestiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my\\r\\nlot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy beloved Sister,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeptember 2d.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to\\r\\nsee again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded\\r\\nby mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush\\r\\nmy vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look\\r\\ntowards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly\\r\\nappalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it\\r\\nis terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through\\r\\nme. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\\r\\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you\\r\\nwill have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved\\r\\nsister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect,\\r\\nmore terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband and lovely\\r\\nchildren; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to\\r\\nfill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He\\r\\nreminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who\\r\\nhave attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful\\r\\nauguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks,\\r\\nthey no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice\\r\\nthey believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish\\r\\nbefore the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\\r\\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by\\r\\nthis despair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeptember 5th.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly\\r\\nprobable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being\\r\\ncrushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate\\r\\ncomrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.\\r\\nFrankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in\\r\\nhis eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he\\r\\nspeedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This\\r\\nmorning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half\\r\\nclosed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half a dozen of the\\r\\nsailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader\\r\\naddressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the\\r\\nother sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in\\r\\njustice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never\\r\\nescape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and\\r\\na free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\\r\\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.\\r\\nThey insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if\\r\\nthe vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea\\r\\nof returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility,\\r\\nrefuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had\\r\\nat first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to\\r\\nattend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with\\r\\nmomentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily\\r\\nturned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? “And\\r\\nwherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a\\r\\nsouthern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every\\r\\nnew incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited,\\r\\nbecause danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and\\r\\novercome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable\\r\\nundertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your\\r\\nspecies, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for\\r\\nhonour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination\\r\\nof danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your\\r\\ncourage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not\\r\\nstrength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly\\r\\nand returned to their warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation;\\r\\nye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a\\r\\ndefeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be\\r\\nsteady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff\\r\\nas your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that\\r\\nit shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked\\r\\non your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not\\r\\nwhat it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in\\r\\nhis speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you\\r\\nwonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to\\r\\nreply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that\\r\\nI would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary,\\r\\nbut that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\\r\\nalmost deprived of life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return\\r\\nshamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men,\\r\\nunsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to\\r\\nendure their present hardships.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeptember 7th.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thus are\\r\\nmy hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and\\r\\ndisappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice\\r\\nwith patience.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeptember 12th.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and\\r\\nglory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter\\r\\ncircumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and\\r\\ntowards you, I will not despond.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a\\r\\ndistance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the\\r\\nmost imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention\\r\\nwas occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree\\r\\nthat he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was\\r\\ndriven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the\\r\\n11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw\\r\\nthis and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a\\r\\nshout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein,\\r\\nwho was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said,\\r\\n“because they will soon return to England.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you, then, really return?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to\\r\\ndanger, and I must return.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but mine is\\r\\nassigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but surely the spirits who\\r\\nassist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.” Saying this, he\\r\\nendeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he\\r\\nfell back and fainted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely\\r\\nextinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was\\r\\nunable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to\\r\\nleave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly\\r\\nnot many hours to live.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by\\r\\nhis bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\\r\\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said,\\r\\n“Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he,\\r\\nmy enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the\\r\\nlast moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of\\r\\nrevenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of\\r\\nmy adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past\\r\\nconduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created\\r\\na rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my\\r\\npower, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty, but there was another\\r\\nstill paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had\\r\\ngreater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of\\r\\nhappiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in\\r\\nrefusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled\\r\\nmalignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to\\r\\ndestruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom;\\r\\nnor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that\\r\\nhe may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction\\r\\nwas mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\\r\\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I\\r\\nam only induced by reason and virtue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task;\\r\\nand now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of\\r\\nmeeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing\\r\\nof what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are\\r\\nalready disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what\\r\\nI think right, for I may still be misled by passion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other\\r\\nrespects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy\\r\\none which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit\\r\\nbefore me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in\\r\\ntranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one\\r\\nof distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I\\r\\nhave myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort,\\r\\nhe sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak\\r\\nbut was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while\\r\\nthe irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious\\r\\nspirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my\\r\\nsorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears\\r\\nflow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey\\r\\ntowards England, and I may there find consolation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze\\r\\nblows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of\\r\\na human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of\\r\\nFrankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sister.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\\r\\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it;\\r\\nyet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and\\r\\nwonderful catastrophe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.\\r\\nOver him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature,\\r\\nyet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his\\r\\nface was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was\\r\\nextended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard\\r\\nthe sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror\\r\\nand sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his\\r\\nface, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily\\r\\nand endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\\r\\nI called on him to stay.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless\\r\\nform of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and\\r\\ngesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my crimes are\\r\\nconsummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,\\r\\nFrankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now\\r\\nask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all\\r\\nthou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me\\r\\nthe duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy,\\r\\nwere now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this\\r\\ntremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was\\r\\nsomething so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but\\r\\nthe words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and\\r\\nincoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a\\r\\npause of the tempest of his passion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you had listened to the\\r\\nvoice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your\\r\\ndiabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then dead to agony\\r\\nand remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not in the\\r\\nconsummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish\\r\\nthat was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful\\r\\nselfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you\\r\\nthat the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\\r\\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and\\r\\nhatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as\\r\\nyou cannot even imagine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and\\r\\novercome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.\\r\\nBut when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its\\r\\nunspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated\\r\\nwretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and\\r\\npassions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy\\r\\nand bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\\r\\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that\\r\\nI was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the\\r\\nmaster, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she\\r\\ndied! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all\\r\\nanguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good.\\r\\nUrged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I\\r\\nhad willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an\\r\\ninsatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to\\r\\nmind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and\\r\\nwhen I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was\\r\\nrekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said. “It is well that you come here to whine\\r\\nover the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of\\r\\nbuildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the\\r\\nfall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be\\r\\nthe object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is\\r\\nnot pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is\\r\\nwithdrawn from your power.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being. “Yet such must be the\\r\\nimpression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet\\r\\nI seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I\\r\\nfirst sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and\\r\\naffection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be\\r\\nparticipated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness\\r\\nand affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I\\r\\nseek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall\\r\\nendure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should\\r\\nload my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and\\r\\nof enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my\\r\\noutward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of\\r\\nunfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now\\r\\ncrime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\\r\\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\\r\\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature\\r\\nwhose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the\\r\\nbeauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes\\r\\na malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and\\r\\nassociates in his desolation; I am alone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes\\r\\nand his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not\\r\\nsum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent\\r\\npassions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.\\r\\nThey were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and\\r\\nI was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the\\r\\nonly criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix,\\r\\nwho drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the\\r\\nrustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\\r\\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to\\r\\nbe spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the\\r\\nrecollection of this injustice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the\\r\\nhelpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his\\r\\nthroat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my\\r\\ncreator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among\\r\\nmen, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he\\r\\nlies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal\\r\\nthat with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I\\r\\nthink on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for\\r\\nthe moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt\\r\\nmy thoughts no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly\\r\\ncomplete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series\\r\\nof my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do\\r\\nnot think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your\\r\\nvessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most\\r\\nnorthern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to\\r\\nashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious\\r\\nand unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall\\r\\ndie. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of\\r\\nfeelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and\\r\\nwhen I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.\\r\\nI shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.\\r\\nLight, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\\r\\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\\r\\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\\r\\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me,\\r\\nI should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes\\r\\nand torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will\\r\\never behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a\\r\\ndesire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my\\r\\ndestruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not\\r\\ncause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst\\r\\nnot ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance\\r\\ngreater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still\\r\\nsuperior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in\\r\\nmy wounds until death shall close them for ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I\\r\\nnow feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I\\r\\nshall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the\\r\\ntorturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will\\r\\nbe swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it\\r\\nthinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay\\r\\nclose to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness\\r\\nand distance.\\r\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 84 ***\\n\\n\\n')]"
